"7","T-shirt","Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts, Multipack, Style G1100, Black/Sport Grey/Military Green (5-Pack)","Colin N.","Like the quality & the material but it is counter-productive to make the sleeves too short to save a few cents by T-shirt. Being made of cotton they shrink considerably when you wash them, so you need to buy them one size bigger. They still earn a 4 star rating because for the price they are being sold at, they are good value for the money.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 28 January 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"15","T-shirt","Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts, Multipack, Style G1100, Black/Sport Grey/Military Green (5-Pack)","markr","The shirts are a solid 4 but the price makes them a 5. They are a little thicker than I anticipated but that is fine with me. I wanted cotton for the moisture wicking ability and these work fine. They are not incredibly soft but they are soft enough for me. I cannot say much about fading but they made it through the first wash and did not bleed onto the other clothes.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I go to the gym often. I hate when I raise my arms and you can see my abs while wearing a shirt. I bought these shirts just because of the price. But I was so happy when I put one on and saw that they were great fitting on top and went way past my waist in length. Going to buy a ton more. I bought L size by the way. Not sure how other sizes are.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"17","T-shirt","Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts, Multipack, Style G1100, Black/Sport Grey/Military Green (5-Pack)","FBB Custom","At first I thought these were great. They are soft, they held up great in the first wash, the price was good. Since then I feel like one or two of them have shrunk in a way that makes the sleeves look stupid. That's basically the biggest problem I have with t shirts. I am too small for a large, mediums fit me out of the package, but if they shrink they look too small on me.So I guess watch out, they might shrink. But otherwise they are mostly pretty okay.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"20","T-shirt","Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts, Multipack, Style G1100, Black/Sport Grey/Military Green (5-Pack)","Royboy","These Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts are on the thin side, so if you're expecting a heavyweight t-shirt, you're going to be disappointed.  These are all cotton, which I prefer, and are very soft and comfortable.  When washed and dried, they end up a wrinkly mess, so don't expect them to look like the ones pictured, except when you first take them from the package.  Speaking of which, why do they have to use the world's stickiest tape to stick to each rolled up shirt in the package?  You should take care in peeling this sticky tape from the shirt so you don't raise the nap and create a ""stripe"" where the tape was attached.  I guess the price is fairly reasonable, as what I paid came to about $4.40 per shirt.  Recommended.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
