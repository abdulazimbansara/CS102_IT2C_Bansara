"2","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Rugby","These are great training shorts. The material is elastic and stretchy on your legs so they move with you as your running and moving. Inside the waist, there is an additional non-slip material that ensure they fit comfortably and don't move around. Great for the gym for work outs or if your out and above running","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"3","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Robert Tammik","Excellent quality as you would expect from Canterbury however the size guide mislead me. I purchased XS as I’m normally 28 waist however these are too small with the elastic being so tight, would fit a 24-26 waist.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 18 December 2019","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"7","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Stephen","Not the quality that I expect from CCC. They didn't even make it through one game of rugby! They ripped all the way down the back when I was squatting down.  I've had $10 Kipster shorts that lasted longer.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 October 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"12","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Rugby","Edit 29th Apr 18. Worn about 20 times since purchase and now ripped at stitching at rear seam whilst squatting. This is not at the stretch panel, shame they didnt use a bit of the stretch panel at the rear seam.Over all still good shorts but just cant handle heavy squatting. I am tempted to try a larger size see if the extra room will perform better.Very strong shorts with stretch material in backside area which is good for squatting, as they don’t rip like most do under heavy load. They have a good rise as well which is rare in today’s climate of shorts hanging half way down your backside. However they are totally let down when it comes to leg room. I purchased a size up from what I needed as recommended in another review and they are barley loose on my thighs. After squatting in them I have been left with red marks and bruising where the material has been so tight around my thighs. I thought rugby shorts would be good due to the leg size of the players, clearly not in this case. If you have larger thighs (mine are only 29 inches, so I don’t consider them large at all) and plan on doing gym work I would avoid these. Such a shame as could have been perfect with 1-2 more inch of thigh room.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"22","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Rugby","Product is sweet. Fits well (230lb 6ft4 with xl) maybe the description stated no pockets but I didn't see it. Good waste band. Took a while to ship but fair price.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"23","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Book Worm","Produkt kam sowas von SOFORT, damit habe ich nicht gerechnet! Die shorts sind rugby-typisch relativ eng und robust - sollte auch am feld eine gute figur machen. Ohne die dehnbaren Stellen am Oberschenkel aussen und im Schritt wäre ein „normales“ Bewegen wohl nicht möglich - für rugby aber wunderbar. Die Shorts sind relativ kurz (wie beschrieben und wie gewollt), relativ eng und mit Größe Large (bei 183 cm Körpergröße und normalerweise Hosengröße je nach Schnitt 34 oder 36) noch gut passend, aber viel Platz ist dann nicht mehr. Qualität wie erwartet sehr gut!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 June 2021","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"32","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Rugby","Great additional elastication made them a great fit for my 9 year old daughter. She’s solid! They don’t trap round her thighs and allow good flex when bending. Much better than the ones without the gusset.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"33","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","SB","Très belle matière, ont sens la qualitée et le rendu final.Il s'agit d'un short qui rend une très belle impression après 3 jours d'utilisation.Peut être juste une remarque négative sur la taille, prendez gardes, car l'élastique est très sérrer, prévoyez peut être une taille au dessus.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"34","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","G. Hawker","These are extremely durable, comfortable shorts. I wear these primarily for no-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and am very pleased with their performance overall. BJJ-oriented brands commonly offer lower quality shorts at nearly double the price.There are just a couple of things I would love to see improved:- The black shorts appear to be very dark blue. If you wear them with anything else that's actually black, the contrast can be pretty obvious.- The ""legs"" could be slightly stretchier to enable greater mobility. There is an elastic panel in the crotch area, and the leg openings are generously sized, but additional elastic panels on the fronts/sides of the legs would be nice.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"38","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Valerie C.","Got these for nogi BJJ and they’ve been great. They’re durable, comfortable and affordable, something BJJ fight shorts usually aren’t. They’re also short, which to some like myself is more comfortable. They don’t have any annoying Velcro, and the grips on the inside of the waistband are a welcome feature. Can’t imagine wearing anything else at this point.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"50","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Grabbert Rainer","I love these shorts. Although a rugby player, I actually bought them for the gym. Having quite big thighs and butt, I struggle with most training pants, particularly at the bottom of the squat. I have ripped several trousers this way and the result with some shorts is that they stick on the thighs and pull the waistband down, so I end up partially mooning the rest of the gym while in the squat rack!The added thick lycra/ stretch areas around the groin and sides of the thighs mean these babies stay right where you put the on and no risk of exploding out of them. Tough and durable as well and the material doesn't fade when washed. So the colour looks crisp still after several washes.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 5 August 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
