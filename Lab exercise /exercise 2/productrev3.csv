"28","T-shirt","Gildan","Franz","Exactly what I needed for basic wardrobe staples. 5 for under $30? Can't go wrong! The colours are good and go with most of the rest of my wardrobe, shirts fit well and don't look boxy or weird. No loose threads or deformities noticed. Seams are minimal and not annoying, no uncomfortable tags in the back. Just a good solid pack of basic tees to keep in rotation.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 8 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"39","T-shirt","Gildan","Benjamin Acosta","These are a great value and fit as expected.  The fabric isn't the softest cotton ever, but it's acceptable.  The only negative is the stitching is inconsistent (good on most, wonky on one, and a bad spot on one seam).For the price they're good.  And I have some old ones of these that I've had for a couple years and they've held up well (long as the stitching doesn't fail).  Wash after wash they never ""pill up"" or get threadworn.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 7 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"40","T-shirt","Gildan","Spoonsoz","I actually returned the shirts because I had inadvertently ordered crew neck instead of vee-neck shirts.I ultimately reordered the same shirts in vee-neck style and same colors.

"43","T-shirt","Gildan","Ricardo fuentes","Provided as a gift!  No complaints so far.  Color t-shirts are being replaced by the white t-shirts.  Too hard to keep white t-shirts white.

"48","T-shirt","Gildan","Amazon Customer","5’9”, 240lbs, 50” chest, 38” waist.Purchased XXL expecting them to shrink to proper size. They did, kinda-where the chest and shoulders fit comfortably well there is a lot of excess room in the mid section. Definitely cut for a more full-figured gentleman. Makes them somewhat awkward to wear, almost like a hospital gown.If, while standing, you can look straight down and see your belt buckle these will probably be a bit generously sized.Otherwise very soft, so much nicer than the cold polyester shirts that are everywhere now.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 17 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
