"8","Shorts","UNIONBAY Men's Survivor Belted Cargo Short-Reg and Big & Tall Sizes","mehmet sadik sapmaz","I love my Unionbay Cargo Shorts. I have three different colours of these shorts for a variety combinations. They are comfortable anytime shorts & a smart social garment. Having lost some weight recently I needed to upgrade my wardrobe & was happy to see the Unionbay brand was still going strong. I like the cut & feel of these shorts & they are well made so the old larger sizes are still good enough to send to charity.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Cuando llegaron las planch√© porque si estaban arrugadas, despues de lavarlas no las he planchado de nuevo. Quedan bien secadas al sol. Las bolsas son amplias, cabe bien la cartera, el celular en una de las del frente, ¬°Y sobra espacio! Me voy a comprar unas iguales de otro color. El cintur√≥n no es la gran cosa.

"25","Shorts","UNIONBAY Men's Survivor Belted Cargo Short-Reg and Big & Tall Sizes","Atnorton","I first ordered size 36, the size I wear in my Carhartt shorts, but the size was much too larger. I returned them and ordered the shorts in a size 34, but these were too big. I returned them for a refund. I liked the features of the UnionBay brand, so I ordered them in a size 32, they fit perfect! Although, I was surprised that they seamed to be made of o heavier cloth material and the small pocket, on each leg, did not have a flap over the pocket. I used the small pocket for small items, like nail clippers, small Leatherman, etc.. The very first day I wore one of the pairs, I lost my favorite nail clippers. A real bummer. Lesson learned: Don't put anything anything in the small pockets because you have a very good chance of loosing whatever you put in them. Other than that, I love the quality of all the different pairs I ordered.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 24 September 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"28","Shorts","UNIONBAY Men's Survivor Belted Cargo Short-Reg and Big & Tall Sizes","Tiffaney","Pro's  They use Velcro instead of buttons on the pocket flaps, it makes it so much easier to open. Buttons make the flaps wrinkle when not buttoned up. Well stitched, The front pockets are deep, so things won't fall out, well worth the money to me. Con's would be that they are 11 inch inseam, and is over the top part of my knee cap. I prefer a 9 inch inseam. Last time I bought cargo shorts was 15 years ago, and the material is thinner then my old ones. The small front pocket on the left side, made for a key fob doesn't have a Velcro flap, and you could possibly lose your key fob if it were to fall out. The belt looks ok, but I use my own belt. I did like these so much, that I decided to buy more.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 28 June 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"32","Shorts","UNIONBAY Men's Survivor Belted Cargo Short-Reg and Big & Tall Sizes","Robert E Sutherland","Great quality and a nice fit. This is my second pair of these shorts and I think that is the best recommendation you can give. These fit well and are nicely finished with velcro on the pockets, not annoying snaps. The pocket flaps are designed in such a way as to not fold over in the wash and stay that way for the life of the garment. Material weight is medium and just right for summer or warmer climates. A casual but good looking pair of shorts. I order these in the same size as my other pants and shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 12 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"33","Shorts","UNIONBAY Men's Survivor Belted Cargo Short-Reg and Big & Tall Sizes","Mark Carpenter","These are the newer version of the cargos and they are quite a bit tighter through the waist, butt and quad.  A friend ripped the inseam out of his while trying to pick up something off the ground.  From his experience, I took it easy on any lifting and have to hike up the legs just to bend over or lift anything.Full disclosure: I have full-figured quads/butt from a lot of weight lifting, but the friend who tore his pants is a slim guy.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 August 2018","1.0 out of 5 stars"

One problem: I've only had them a year and the crotch has worn thin and torn. Most cargo shorts I buy are way more sturdy. I'm not an extreme athlete nor am I doing anything to increase the normal wear and tear. These shorts got worn out by a guy just walking around. Think I'll try a different brand for my next purchase.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 December 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"42","Shorts","UNIONBAY Men's Survivor Belted Cargo Short-Reg and Big & Tall Sizes","Robert E Sutherland","Hangs just above the knee. The sizing is on point, but generous. 11"" inseam is great. Side pocket depth is good, flaps adequate. I like the velcro closures on the pocket flaps. I dont use the rear pockets. No current problem with my stitching, after 1 wash. Fabbed in Shri Lanka. Fabric is decent thickness and soft. Minimal number of belt loops. I like the color (Android), it looks like the pic. 1 point off for the zipper, which the up/down movement is not smooth, concern the this may limit the life of the shorts. Also the belt is a waste of material. Should can the belt and put that savings into a better, smoother operating zipper, then I'd give these shorts a 5! But from a price standpoint, I would recommend.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 12 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
