I have some that are over 5 years old and I‚Äôm still wearing them. They have been washed thousands of times and hold up well.

"14","T-shirt","Gildan Men's Heavy Cotton Short Sleeve T-Shirt, 2-Pack","HusbandAndWifeNL","I tried this shirt on when it first arrived, and it smelled so powerfully of some mystery chemical that I took it off right away and put it in the wash. After one wash it still smells very strongly, but is at least bearable. I hope it doesn't give me a rash.Besides that, the material is a bit rough, and bunches up at the back of my neck. I think I'll try another brand next time.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 9 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"15","T-shirt","Gildan Men's Heavy Cotton Short Sleeve T-Shirt, 2-Pack","Lady Leaf","MADE IN NICARAGUA. I just washed my 2 new black shirts. They came out  with the normal cotton, sort of rough. Color held. They aren't heavy like old beefy-t shirts.  I think they will be a perfect for the summer. Not see through. Not that well made I think if you are rough on the arm pit area (no top stitch to reinforce them) could be a problem but for $9.99 for 2, 100% cotton, not bad. The tags are going to be itchy (very sharp corners and very stiff) I will cut them off. UPDATE: I put my shirt on for the first time this season. I love it. I got a bigger size as I am handicapped and in a wheelchair. I would order the the shirts again. Oh, by the way, the tags aren't itchy!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 4 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"19","T-shirt","Gildan Men's Heavy Cotton Short Sleeve T-Shirt, 2-Pack","sam","I'm 6'4 and 280#, so I wear a 3X sized t-shirt.  I ordered the Gildan because my wife got me a few for Christmas last year.  The fit on these is awkward for tall people.  I would have returned them if not for the fact that my daughter threw them in the wash first thing (cold).  Maybe that was her plan since she and my wife are getting them for sleep shirts now.  Comfortable shirts, soft fabric, not too thick, not too thin.  Just not long enough in 3X","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"21","T-shirt","Gildan Men's Heavy Cotton Short Sleeve T-Shirt, 2-Pack","Customer","First off, they shipped really slowly and I'm losing weight and need smaller clothes ASAP. Secondly, The material and fabric is coming loose in strands maybe a month after getting the shirts. Thirdly, If you get these use them as a temporary solution like it makes sense for weight loss. I'm glad I only bought two in Black. Lastly, it is okay for the price... What else would you expect though, right?","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 25 January 2023","4.5 out of 5 stars"

I was disappointed to see that its still very thin and nowhere near as comfortable and thick as the beefy t's.  I'm too lazy to refund so I will just use em as pajama shirts but yeah if you're looking for a thick cotton shirt just don't buy Gildan.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 16 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It does not run true to size, then when it is washed, it runs about 1 1/2 sizes smaller. a XL is a between an Large and a medium.
