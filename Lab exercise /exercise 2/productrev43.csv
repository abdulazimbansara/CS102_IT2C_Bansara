"27","Shorts","Under Armour UA Tech Short, Mens, Bottoms, Shorts, 10 in","Mike H.","Note: I paid just under $30 for these shorts, which is the lowest price I've seen them. The pants, as they come, are really light way and comfortable. Length and fit felt great.Only thing I hated was that the back pockets were sewn semi-shut (meaning there are actual pockets, but they stitch it closed inside). This was almost a dealbreaker as I'm used to reserving those pockets for my wallet and phone, but I was able to cut the stitching so they are functional. 4/5 as the pants come. 5/5 after the alteration.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
