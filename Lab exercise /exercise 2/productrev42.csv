"4","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","TheMattDaddy","Awesome! Love them. Keep me cool on hot days/runs. Draw string works well. Trimmed drawstring down a little in length as it was too long for my liking (no longer than typical with other shorts).","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 19 October 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"5","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Clark Lohr","Russell Athletics makes great basketball shorts, great t-shirts, good hoodies. I'm sure there's tons of competition from other brands that are pricier and appear to be more exotic and somehow better but it's not true. Russell Athletics is good clothing--and you can get it at general merchandise stores.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"6","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Zenguy","I prefer a basic, no-frills, inexpensive workout short for my exercise activities (about 1-1.5 hours per day, 3-4 times per week). After years of buying Champion brand, I decided to give the Russell product a try based on positive reviews. I found these to be a good value. What I like most about them is the fit, which is a bit looser and longer than the Champion model.  At 5'8"", 165 lbs with a 33 waist, medium is just perfect for me. The material is smooth and breathes well. The waist is snug enough for the shorts to stay put, but not too tight to be comfortable. I like the pockets, which I use to hold my little iPod shuffle during my workouts. Overall a solid product and sufficient for my purposes.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 March 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars"

They look good, and they feel good.One thing is that the white ones are pretty see-through, so your underwear color will show a little bit if they are dark or flashy.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 17 March 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"23","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","sallyftw","I don't usually review items promptly but the customer service is something to talk about.  I ordered a size L and they sent me an M.  The paper tag said L but the actual tag on the shorts said M so the mix-up was understandable.  I ordered a size L a second time so they would arrive on time for my boyfriend's birthday and emailed amazon about returning the size M.  I heard back right away from the seller and was told that my money will be refunded and that I do not have to go through the hassle of returning the shorts.The new shorts that were correctly labeled size L on both tags came in today and they are great.  The Texas Orange is a beautiful burnt copper color and I couldn't be happier about it.  The shorts themselves are long which is great because my boyfriend is 6ft 4 and has trouble with basketball shorts being too short sometimes, but these will look great on him.  The pockets are a big plus because he likes to have a place to put his keys and phone when he goes out.  The elastic on the shorts is really strong but very stretchy meaning that they will be comfortable but won't fall down.  What I loved the most about the shorts is how thin the material is.  My boyfriend gets very sweaty and always complains about shorts being 'too hot' but these are so airy and light that I think he will love them.  I will be ordering in more colors after I get his take on these shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"26","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Haron Deinla","These shorts were definitely worth the buy. A lot better than I had expected, and here's why:-the shorts a very comfy. That may be due to the mesh being a little bit bigger in perforations as compared to other mesh shorts. The perforations are big enough to provide more than enough breathing room and ventilation, but not so big that the shorts are super-see through.-the material not only feels good but looks good. I ordered the green colorway and it looks really nice. I'm even planning on making another order, that is if I decide whether or not these are better quality than Champion branded shorts.-it has pockets which is a must for me when it comes to shorts I plan to use on a consistent basis to be able to hold my keys and wallet.-the drawstring is also strong enough so that if I were to have my phone, keys and wallet in my pockets, the shorts won't drop.All in all, these shorts are really nice, both for home use and outdoor use for walking and sports alike.If I were able to help you make a purchase, or help you prevent from making one you'd regret. Then all I ask is you thumbs up my review saying it was helpful, because knowing I helped someone out means a lot.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 10 August 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"50","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","D.D.","(I did not receive any compensation, discount or free products for my review. I don't work for this company. This is just flat honesty.)  The first thing I can say is I am pleasantly surprised that shorts of this quality come at such a low price point. That is a big selling point here. I could buy Nike, but why when I can get the same thing for $11-$12 bucks? That seems like a waste of money. Mind you, I'm not a, ""Keep up with the Jones' kind of guy.)  So, unless you just have to have a ""brand,"" buy 3 or 4 pair of these instead.  **After having having several pair of these shorts for over a month I came back to edit my review from a 4 star rating to a 5. I suppose since I've already ordered several additional pair I really like them. I wear them around the house every day. They are extremely comfortable - not only for relaxing but for yard work, painting, etc. In fact, I like these shorts so much that I hate it when I don't have a pair clean, so like I said, ""I ordered more!""  I live in central hell, where the summer climate is so hot that the last thing you want to do is work outside or in a hot garage. Yet, the mesh fabric accomplishes its job -matching the description. The mesh allows heat to escape and maintain a cool feeling without trapping in sweat. (Whomever created the fabric should be rich by now.) When beckoned I come in from the garage, sit down at the dinner table and the shorts are throughly dry.  *The shorts launder easily and hold up well in hot water and a hot dryer. No special steps required. I don't like athletic shorts that you can't just toss in the dryer. Some expensive shorts state, ""Wash only. Hang to dry."" That's too much work! Draw string is one piece with a knot below, so you don't have to worry about loosing the string in the washer and then trying to find it and put it back in. (I hate that.)  Exercising: I've worked out for 35 years, and I can tell you these are some of the coolest and most comfortable shorts I've ever worn. The pockets are the perfect depth. There is plenty of room to fit my keys and iphone 6-plus. Unlike some shorts, whatever is in my pocket's stays there. It does not fall out. (The manufacturer gets some points there.) I don't have to worry about loosing my keys, an adventure I'd rather skip. (Of course, be logical.) I wouldn't recommend engaging in heavy athletic activities with expensive items in your pocket, yet I can wear the shorts to make a quick trip to the store without my phone falling out.  Importantly, there is plenty of room in the circumference of the legs to allow for men with very muscular thighs. The fabric stretches a bit, but will not remain stretched out. If you have huge thighs you might consider ordering a size larger than normal unless you fancy very tight shorts? I've never had that issue. There is ample room in the crotch for any man; however, be aware that you will not get any athletic support from the shorts. So, depending you your preference and need you may wish to wear protection underneath.  Lastly, the shorts are a bit longer than I expected. The waist to knee measures 19"" and the crotch to bottom of shorts is 13"". I am 6'3"", and the bottom meets the top of my knee.  That is a thorough review of the shorts. I hope it helps you make an educated decision.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 May 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"
