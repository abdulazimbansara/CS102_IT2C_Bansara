"3","T-shirt","Champion Men's Classic Jersey","Clyde McGhee","Had to return this as it was far too small. Also, the material felt a little scratchy, less soft and comfortable than other Champion t shirts that I have.

"9","T-shirt","Champion Men's Classic Jersey","gee","Cheap, but feels good quality with only subtitle logo ( which I like). Wrinkles allot after wash, maybe due to good quality cotton material. I brought this for casual wear, so can’t be bothered ironing. Normally just a quick steam, but that didn’t do much. Maybe I am too low quality for the shirt?","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 12 August 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"24","T-shirt","Champion Men's Classic Jersey","Michael Markus","Great quality t-shirt but the sizing is smaller than the typical sizing on other t-shirts.I'm a size Medium and quite slim (6ft and weigh 66kg).I find these t-shirts quite tight fitting, shorter on the arms and the length only just covers the waistband of my shorts.I've never had to order a size larger but with these t-shirts I really do need too.The material is great quality and they're really well made. It's just a shame about the sizing for me.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 10 December 2020","2.0 out of 5 stars"

"31","T-shirt","Champion Men's Classic Jersey","Clyde McGhee","These T shirts are comfortable, the right thickness and easy to care.Some T shirts are just uncomfortable to wear against the body.  They are usually 100% synthetic and they feel like you're wearing a plastic garbage bag.  They entice you to buy them with low prices.This T shirt is super comfortable.  It has the right blend of cotton and polyester so that it feels good on the skin, is not super thin so it has the right warmth for a T shirt, does not shrink, and is mostly wrinkle free.And they look good.  I'm 5'8"" and weigh about 170 pounds, and I like my T shirts to fit loosely but not look like a tent.  XXL fits perfectly for me.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 27 December 2021","4.3 out of 5 stars"

"48","T-shirt","Champion Men's Classic Jersey","Tom","You just put this thing on.. it fits and feels great.. and you go out or lounge at home completely at ease. I liked the first two so much and I went ahead and bought eight more and a couple of repeat colors. These t-shirts also look much higher quality than the $10 or $11 that I paid for them. I look so urbane driving around in my 2-door Jeep Wrangler. I am now thinking of getting a few more for a couple of family members and a couple of close friends when I travel to India next time.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 1 May 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
