"7","Shorts","Real Essentials 5 Pack: Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Active Athletic Performance Shorts","Kayden Gabriel","These shorts are super comfortable and good for the gym. The order was good except for the one short they sent that was the wrong size. Another important thing to mention is that when stretched, they are translucent since the fabric is not very thick.  So make sure you use compression pants or dark undergarments beneath these shorts. Otherwise, they work well for exercises that need lots of flexibility, squatting, etc. They are also very comfortable to wear at home! I love this product and will probably order more in the future. Great money value and great quality. Very satisfied!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 1 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"10","Shorts","Real Essentials 5 Pack: Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Active Athletic Performance Shorts","Chris","For what they cost, I cannot possibly complain about the quality of these pants. They are very breathable and comfortable to wear when going to the gym, or when hanging out at home. 5 pairs was enough for me to have gym shorts for each day I go to the gym and I haven't had a single complaint about these shorts. The material seems like it might wear down/rip at some point within the next 2 years if I had to guess but for the price I can't really complain.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"20","Shorts","Real Essentials 5 Pack: Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Active Athletic Performance Shorts","AS","I have two sets of these shorts, one I purchased in august of 2020 and one in august 2021. Clearly I went back to buy another set a year later so I must like them, and I do. They are priced INCREDIBLY well. At the time of the first purchase, I had just started playing sports again and needed lightweight shorts to cut and move in. These are DEFINITELY those shorts. They breath very well, they're comfortable enough that now I not only work out in them, I lounge around the house in them and go to sleep in them as well. They've held up pretty well to washing. I wash them on hot with powdered detergent and oxiclean powder and rinse them twice and then dry them on medium heat. They've probably gone through at least 100 washes thus far and I'm still wearing them. Yes, some of the seams have loose thread, yes some of them start to come off over time but they're $6 a short and none of them have unraveled to the point that there are any holes or they are unwearable, it's just something you would see when you look at the inner part of the waistband.The ONE weakness of these shorts is the pockets. I've had several that have started developing holes in the side seams of the pockets. Now it only started happening a year+ later and they've been beat up and washed many times so that's not quite so bad, but still it'll happen. I suspect this is more to do with how big and heavy phones are nowadays since it's always on my right pocket (where my phone goes) and started pretty much after I upgraded from an iphone 7 to an iphone 13 pro. But two years and 100+ aggressive washings later, only 3 out of 10 shorts have pocket holes and only one has a hole big enough that I'm scared to put my phone in the pocket.These are fantastic shorts and they could easily charge double. I plan to replace some of the original ones with a new set even now.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 September 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"26","Shorts","Real Essentials 5 Pack: Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Active Athletic Performance Shorts","Erik","I bought these fully expecting them to be horrible just due to the price. They surprisingly weren't that bad. However, they are not very well made. More than one pair had pockets that the stitching missed, rendering the pockets useless. On the bright side these short are very comfortable and preform the task that I expected them to do. I use them as pajamas, for exercise, laundry day wear and lounge wear. I am satisfied but the over quality needs improvement.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 23 February 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Everyone who says they are see through have never looked at their other pairs of shorts. I have a pair of Nike shorts that if you hold up to the light you can see right through just like these ones. You can‚Äôt see anything when they are on your body, and if you can then they are too tight and that is your problem.

I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and prefer to wear shorts that are right at knee cap level. These fit perfectly. I lived through the 80‚Äôs and will never wear short shorts again. The fabric is cool to the touch and moisture dissipates quickly. These do not snag as easily as other shorts I‚Äôve owned but they will if they catch on something.

"36","Shorts","Real Essentials 5 Pack: Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Active Athletic Performance Shorts","Amazon Customer","I originally ordered a set of these before Christmas 2023, and the package I got only contained 3 of the correct shorts and 2 other cheap shorts that I can only consider ""filler"" that was added to the package. Was immensely disappointed in those 2 cheaper shorts (they were stained and seemed to be in a warehouse for some time as the elastic in the waistband was audible when stretched as if already dry-rotting).The correct shorts were great, they were much thinner than I expected, but very breathable and elastic. Decided to give it another shot and purchased the same item once more and actually got 5 correct branded shorts this time, same quality that I was hoping for. This time there was even a thank you card in the packaging and the packaging was different to my first order. Makes me wonder if it was a different seller the first time around.If you need some nice athletic shorts, for casual around the house wear, or exercising, these are the shorts I recommend you get.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 7 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Material's a bit thinner than I expected -- bit like wearing PJ bottoms, but that makes no nevermind to me.  One thing - I did agonise somewhat about which size to get before ordering.  I've got a 41-inch waist and the table suggests XXL or even XXXL.  All the previous clothes I've bought through Amazon were Size L, but that was a little while back.  Anyway, I bit the bullet and ordered Size L despite what the table says, and it fits just fine.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  (I might be a little on the large size, but I'm not enormous.)","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"42","Shorts","Real Essentials 5 Pack: Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Active Athletic Performance Shorts","Tim Faucett","Okay I wad surprised. This material they use for the shorts are great. The 5 pack was a 3x for me. They weren't even close what I had expected. The string to tie the shorts was short and such. That I had 1 side or the other ending up pulled into the enclosed part of the shorts where the string comes through. So it's frustrating because once this happens. We'll it's very challenging to retrieve the string.Also from the size descriptions. My size should have been perfect according to Amazon's statistics and what my purchase history has been. Got the big and tall shorts in 3x and they were loose. Had to really since uo the rope or string. It was fine.The five pack is very fairly priced. Felt that it would be awesome. Had ordered the quick dry shirts in big and tall. Now those were from the same company. Ordered 3 sets of 3 shirts packs.Will continue buying from this company. Price is very reasonable. Love that you get a wide variety of colors and packs of 3 to 5 items. The clothing is well packaged and arrives in a fair timely fashion. As a bigger heavier man. Like that they carry the variety of sizes that fit bigger people. Because it's hard finding products in the 3x and bigger sizes.Personally live black and dark blue.  So if those colors are available. Will purchase them. Recommend this company's products for everyone.Well, try them,  and enjoy. Will see you in the next review. Thanks again for your patience and time. Do not like putting any negative thought about anything. It's a trial and error world.That's the amazing thing about Amazon. If you got a problem. They are awesome in their care to their customers.Feel free to ask questions. Welcome them. Because more information and experience, helps others. To another day in paradise. Have a good one.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 16 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
