"2","T-shirt","Carhartt","Sebastian","Amazon is (as usual) not very clear with the description of the item. This is a thicker fabric ""relaxed fit"" T-shirt. Good quality. Most people will have to go down a size. I usually wear a size XL or XXL in tshirts. I wear a Large with this particular t-shirt.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Sweden on 18 September 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"3","T-shirt","Carhartt","Jan B.","Habe die Shirts in diversen Farben und bin sehr zufrieden. Der Stoff ist sehr dick und robust, die Shirts sehen auch nach vielen Wäschen noch gut aus. Qualitativ liegen sie meiner Meinung nach deutlich über diversen Premiummarken, preislich aber deutlich drunter. Achtung: Da Carhartt und nicht Carhartt WIP eigentlich für den amerikanischen Markt gedacht und fallen daher sehr groß aus. Mindestens eine Nummer kleiner kaufen, wenn nicht sogar zwei","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 16 November 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"6","T-shirt","Carhartt","Daniel E.","I was looking for a heavy duty T shirt that will last as I'm a fleet mechanic. These T shirts are amazing. Warm, hard wearing and a good size. They don't shrink in the wash and are a better quality than most work clothing you can buy these days.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"10","T-shirt","Carhartt","J","Tråkigt att det är 90% bomull och 10% polyester. Det gör tröjan säkert mer hållbar och billigare men den känns lite sträv mot huden och polyestern diskvalificerar den som arbetströja för min del då jag jobbar med heta arbeten. För övrigt är storleken standard oversize Carhartt så ta en storlek mindre än vanligt.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Sweden on 23 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"11","T-shirt","Carhartt","Augusto GG","Tengan en cuenta que es relaxed fit, si están pensando comprar esta playera compárenla en la talla habitual, a menos que les guste que les quede entallada elije una talla menos.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 7 February 2022","4.5 out of 5 stars"

"14","T-shirt","Carhartt","idlegamer82","Have been buying Duluth Trading Company shirts for more money and finally decided to give these a try for a cheaper price. Would recommend and very happy with the purchase. They run a little large, nice weight and feel sturdy enough for hard labor. Not recommended for hot weather.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 24 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"17","T-shirt","Carhartt","Luis David Pérez alvarez","Excelente camiseta, tela fina y gruesa, normalmente pido una talla mas grande pues me siento muy cómodo con ropa un poco mas holgada, mi talla normal es "" M"".... y siempre pido "" G "".Pero aquí les explican al cliente sobre esta playera, que hay que pedir una talla menos, y yo pedí mi talla "" M"" y aun así me quedó holgada, pero a mi gusto.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 15 May 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"18","T-shirt","Carhartt","Canadian95","Carhartt work tees are the way to go. Great fit and comfortable at work. Durable and feel premium. I’m 6’0 180lbs for reference. I recommend the medium, as I buy all my Carhartt a size down. The quality is definitely worth it, and the pocket comes in handy.Note: the medium black pocket tee (at least for the medium) is the Loose Fit and not the Relaxed Fit.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 3 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"26","T-shirt","Carhartt","Amazon Customer","The medium shirt I ordered fits as a large, people claiming it is true to size are crazy, I've never had a medium shirt fit like this. The length of the shirt is way too long, the sleeves almost go past my elbow and for a fit that they claim  is ""a closer fit to the body built for work"" it is quite baggy. Maybe they are designed for big boned people (the brand is American so makes sense).","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"28","T-shirt","Carhartt","kate","This product is as expected. Sizing looks correct and quality is good.My only issue is the packaging this was delivered in. I brought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. As with 99% of items brought from amazon items are delivered in cardboard packaging. This item was delivered in a see through plastic bag, and my husband was the one who got delivered it. So his Christmas present is no longer a surprise.Just something to think about if you are buying this for a gift and that person lives at the same address as you.Otherwise great product.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
