"2","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Customer X","These shorts are great, I have bough 2 pairs now. Definitely would recommend.Pros:The color selection is on point.They are super lightweight and comfortable.The waist band is elastic, which is always a plus. They fit on the normal side, maybe a tad large.The double left-hand cellphone pocket in the font is such a good design choice.The black are formal enough to wear to a more classy event.The anti-stain material is no joke, water and other things just repel off of them.The pockets are mesh inside.Cons:The 2 cargo pocket zippers are a bit difficult to zip.No zipper on back pocketsIts sometimes hard to remember that these shorts use snap buttons","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 21 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"9","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","usernotaloser","I bought a very similar pair of Wrangler shorts at Wal-Mart and the fabric was much thicker and better quality than this pair.  These feel kinda cheap; the fabric feels like it could tear fairly easily while the store bought pair, despite being used heavily for cycling for months and washed many times are now faded but the fabric and stitching are fine.Edit to my previous post ...My previous opinion was that I wouldn't buy these again but now after using them for some time, the fabric is holding out very well .... still feel very light and the mesh pockets are a little shallow.  Still a decent short.  I do hope they come out with the original pair of Wrangler shorts I bought almost two years ago.  They have a much sturdier fabric though a little heavy in really hot summer days.  Sturdiness and good pockets mean more than style etc. to me.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 29 April 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"13","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Darlut & MyCorn","Size: I'm legit 38"" if not a little more. A lot of the reviews say true to size so I ordered the 38"".  If I lost a pound and jumped up and down they would have fallen to my ankles.  I guess if you like wearing a belt and like that really loose feel then stick to the 38"".  I'm big shoulders no butt so I need that little bit of extra tension to keep my drawers up. I reordered the 36"" and they fit great. Puts the ""Flex"" to a little but of test but that's what it's there for and it's comfortable. Also the smaller size looks better because the legs aren't so large. There was a huger difference between the 38"" and 36"".Performance: I usually graduate my clothes to ""yard gear"" after they have had a year or so of normal wear. I immediately put these to the test doing yard work and I will wear these from now on.  They were light which kept me cool, the waist was flexible but comfortably snug and the front pockets were deep enough to hold my phone with no issues. I push-mow a large yard and bag the clippings. My neighbors will appreciate that now when I bend over to remove the bagger they won't be confused that a plumber is doing my yardwork. Highly recommend these and also recommend the Flex version of the Wrangler jeans that are sized in a similar fashion.  I have bought another pair and will likely buy a few more. I would even work out at the gym in these when that time comes... maybe having these will motivate me to get there.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 7 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"19","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","BryWill32606","I am able to wear shorts to work and I saw these and figured to give them a try.  First I must say, as a guy I am used to the demin or thick cotton feel for pants/shorts, these are not that feel. These are a stretchy material. When wearing them they are very comfortable and when you sit, as a guy the material is stretchy so you can sit down comfortably without issues. They look like regular shorts, I feel the waistband is a little wider but not in a bad way. I have washed this pair 3x now, they wash well, no fading or coming apart as I read in one review but they do look wrinkly, not bad enough to have to iron them, besides when you put them on the wrinkles seem to go away, I think its the stretchy material that makes them look that way. I paid $27 for this paid off shorts and it's about as hight as I would want to pay. I do need to mention that I did order a second pair, black as these are more of an olive color.  I hope this review helps.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"24","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Amazon Shopper","I am glad I bought these shorts. For the sake of comfort I bought them one size larger than what I usually buy, and they fit perfectly. The zippered pockets are just big enough for a Samsung Galaxy A53 phone, with some minor difficulty in closing and opening the zipper once the phone is in the pocket. The only disappointment is that the front button is not a button at all, but a snap-on  as shown in the picture. My experience with snaps is that they have broken off after some use, so I will be careful using this one. I was pleasantly surprised by the extra pocket inside the left front pocket. All of the front pockets are deep enough to securely hold your keys and wallet. Edited to say: I bought these at a different size five months later. The material in the first pair I bought looks quite worn, from use and washings, compared to the newer pair.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"34","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","David Zacchei","I was looking for shorts that were lightweight, wrinkle resistant, and flexible for a trip to Europe. I was also looking for extra pockets, but I don't like cargo pants with flaps or buttons. Wrangler had the perfect answer. These shorts fit great, and the material (mostly nylon) is lightweight and flexible. They come with two zipper pockets that are perfect for traveling or day-to-day. They are cut a bit narrow in the leg, which is fine for me (5'10"", 170lb.) I bought granite (dark gray) and sagebrush (grayish green). I tried the bronze but didn't like the color. I wish they came in a lighter shade, like khaki or beige.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"44","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Jeremy Thielman","4 or 5 years ago when the ATG line came out I absolutely loved the shorts and pants. The wear and tear has me looking at re-uping the whole wardrobe. I ordered my first pair of shorts and was happy opening. 1st noticed they changed from a button to a snap fastener, meh, okay, prefer button. 2nd notice was a bigger deal, these shorts are two inches longer inseam length than the previous line. At 5'9"" I liked that the old shorts were just above the knee. Any shorts that hang below the knee are a grotesque late 90's jnko white trash look. 3rd, with the extra length, these new line shorts sit higher on the waist. It feels like the belt needs to sit an inch below the navel rather on the hips like the old line.PROS: Love the elastic fabric, light weight, great form fit for muscular legs, most comfortable shorts I've ever owned.CONS: Downgrade from previous years, longer, sits higher, snap fastener, binding after washing, stitching has never been top quality.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"48","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Amazon Customer","Did a bunch of looking for value cargo shorts with zippers. Ordered from Pudilla, and Jessie after narrowing the field, and the wranglers were the best. The material seems sturdy enough for good use, but is super flexable, breathes, and is very comfortable to wear. They also handle getting wet well, and the pockets are well laid out. The belt loops are big, and no pockets are stupidly small.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 15 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"49","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","PM Advocate","First, the description of these cargo shorts on Amazon is totally inadequate. The absolutely most important feature of these shorts that is not evident on the Amazon web site is that they truly have STRETCH. I an a waist 33 and I ordered a 32. They fit perfectly since the waist and the pants have great stretch. They would also fit perfectly for someone with a 32 inch waist. Too many pants on the internet are described as having a stretch feature, but in fact do not. Secondly, there is not description of the pockets. These shorts have 7 pockets, but you would not know it from the website. Zippers are on the two side cargo pockets so you can secure your phone and wallet in these pockets if you will be exercising. The other pockets are deep, as is the ""watch"" pocket. Great fabric. I reordered another pair after wearing the first pair. Can't address durability, but they are made much better than my other cargo shorts. Great buy!!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 June 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
