"13","Shorts","CARHARTT Men's Force Relaxed Fit Ripstop Cargo Work Short","Craig","I generally prefer a 'baggy' style of shorts or pants, but these are very comfortable. I find most straight leg styles constricting and snug in the wrong places. These do not have that problem and don't look like they're 3 sizes too large. I recommend them.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 5 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"15","Shorts","CARHARTT Men's Force Relaxed Fit Ripstop Cargo Work Short","Tim M.","Eigentlich großartig wie fast alle Produkte von Carhartt. Schade ist allerdings, das offensichtlich jeder Hosentyp eine andere Größe hat. Sonst passt mir eine W34 sehr gut, hier ist die W34 recht klein.

"31","Shorts","CARHARTT Men's Force Relaxed Fit Ripstop Cargo Work Short","J. Klaus","The material feels like it should be able to stand up to a fair bit of abuse.  I really like the fact that the flaps on the cargo pockets have an opening in the center which allows you to slide things down into the pocket without having to open the flap - my cell phone fits perfectly.  That opening in the threading that attaches the flap to the leg also keeps the pant leg from getting too stiff there and makes them less binding than the legs on my other work shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 5 May 2022","4.6 out of 5 stars"
