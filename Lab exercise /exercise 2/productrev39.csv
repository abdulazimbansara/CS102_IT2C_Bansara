They fit perfectly.I am 6’3” and 225 pounds.Recently I lost about 7 pounds and they still fit good but starting to get loose.  I suspect once I get below 215 the 36” waist will fit better than the 38” waist.

"34","Shorts","Lee Mens 21861 Extreme Motion Swope Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Jessica Jeppesen","The comfort level of these shorts is outstanding. The fabric has just the right amount of stretch, allowing for unrestricted movement during any physical activity. Whether I'm hiking, cycling, or simply lounging around, the shorts never feel restrictive or uncomfortable. The waistband is adjustable and features a flex waist for a customizable fit, adding to the overall comfort factor.In terms of durability, the Lee Men's Extreme Motion Swope Cargo Shorts certainly impressed me. I have worn them on multiple occasions, and they have held up remarkably well. The construction feels solid, and the stitching is strong, ensuring that these shorts will withstand the test of time. Even after frequent use and washing, I have not noticed any signs of wear or tear.The cargo pockets are another notable feature of these shorts. They provide ample storage space for essentials like keys, a phone, or a small wallet. The pockets are deep enough to securely hold items, and the Velcro closures ensure that nothing falls out during physical activities or when you're on the move.The only reason I deducted one star from the rating is that, while the shorts are durable overall, the color tends to fade slightly after repeated washes. However, this is a minor drawback and doesn't significantly impact the functionality or overall appeal of the shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 February 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"38","Shorts","Lee Mens 21861 Extreme Motion Swope Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Julio Treviño","I’m a 46 year old suburban dad who wears cargo shorts, New Balance shoes and dad hats. I know who I am, and am comfortable with that. There was a period when dads in cargo shorts was a running joke. But I’ll take it; I’m not giving up my cargo shorts for anything.These shorts are the very best of the best when it comes to practical utility. Affordable (often on sale), stretchy in the waist for those days I eat a big sandwich or two, and deep pockets for storing all kinds of stuff. They’re even a little trim. I’m 5’8”/170-175 lb with a 34 waist and I get these in a 33 for a nice comfy fit. Basically a man-purse you can wear.If someone tells me my shorts are anything less than awesome, I’ll tell ‘em I’d care about their opinion but I’m too busy stashing snacks in my awesome pockets. Peace.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 23 July 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Very comfortable, strong and light weight material. The deep cell phone pocket on the right thy is a huge plus. No need to unbutton one of the larger pockets to get at it. No need to risk sitting on it and breaking it in a back pocket. The rest of the pockets are great to have if you are heading to the park or beach.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 23 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
