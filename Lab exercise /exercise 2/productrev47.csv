"13","Shorts","Under Armour Men's UA Tech Graphic Short","Thunderlips","Ich mag die Marke Under Armour sehr. Ansprechende Qualit√§t & tolle Optik, f√ºr Sportbegeisterte immer eine gute Wahl. Ich hab die wei√üe Variante hier f√ºr kleines Geld gekauft. War ein Angebot, hier sollte man wei√üe Unterw√§sche tragen, da die Hose sehr durchsichtig ist. Sehr leicht und Under Armour typisch etwas weiter wie z.b. Adidas Shorts.Klare Kaufempfehlung.
