"3","Shorts","LEE Men's Carpenter Jean Short","Graham","This was the second attempt to order LEE men's carpenter shorts size 40. Twice I was sent size 36 shorts, after returning the first incorrect sized item, for which I received a credit.Rather than have the hassle to return again, I gifted the size 36 shorts that fitted a friend.The Lee product seem to be good quality, I just would prefer Amazon not to advertise a product size, when they appear not to have that particular size in stock.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I had two pair prior to this one and they were comfortable and very handy with the additional pockets.

"23","Shorts","LEE Men's Carpenter Jean Short","Bob Steinman","I really love this shorts.  Just feels great and fun to wear.  Only thing was that the fabric was buckled a bit around one leg.  Being kind of nerdy, I sort of wished I had exchanged them, but something probably only I would notice.  Nevertheless, I do enjoy them, and Lee products as a whole.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 June 2018","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"25","Shorts","LEE Men's Carpenter Jean Short","Big-D","Whether its a pair of jeans or shorts, I prefer Lee brand. Why? Not only do they fit perfectly and are very comfortable, but they have those little pockets on the side of the right leg that perfectly holds a cell phone or a pair of glasses in the case. At 40 my eyes kind of went down hll, so I always have my reading glasses with me. I don't like carrying them in my ants pocket, because the wire frames get all bent up. If I have a shirt pocket, I'll end up losing my glasses because they always want to fall out. So the easy solution is to wear Lee Carpenter jeans and shorts. If you carry your phone or glasses around all of the time, try a pair of these on for size. You won't lose your phone or your glasses with these on and they fit and look great too! What more can you ask for?Edit: I really wanted to give these shorts a Five Star Rating, but when they arrived, one of the belt loops had been poorly sewn and because I use the belt loops to hang my car keys with garage door opener from, that is a big issue with me. If I had purchased these from a local store, I would have noticed the bad sewn belt loop and put them back to select a different pair. This defect is the fault of Amazon, not the quality of the shorts themselves. I still love the fit and usual finish of these shorts and their pants.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 December 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars"

At 5'9"", the opening of the legs cut into the back of my legs where my knees bend which is very uncomfortable.
