"3","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","J D","It's a very nice, soft and comfortable t-shirt. It's warm - think Canadian summer wear, so its good for a sunny autumn/spring Australian day. The look is very authentic 'well worn'. I have some lucky brand denim shorts that I get a lot of wear out of every summer so I bought this on special (<$20) for someone, but I've worn it and it definitely feels like ' a favourite shirt'. I wouldn't pay $60 for it though, lol, unless you really need an old t-shirt fast because someone has just thrown all your clothes out and you really need that soft, cuddly feel.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 17 October 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"9","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","KK","Wore it once and the color came off and stained my favourite backpack. Also, armpit area and the back of the shirt that experienced abrasion will have a lot of small tiny firm balls of lint as shown in the picture attached.

"19","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","Paul Maynard","Really pleased with the style and fit. It comes from the states, but was here within a week. I'm on the border between medium and large depending on the brand, I risked a medium and pleased to say this is a perfect fit, not tight, but also not too baggy. The material is very soft and thin, making it great for hot weather. I chose the dark olive which looks exactly like the photos. I'll definitely be ordering more of these!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"37","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","Rick Shaw","These shirts are a great alternative to men's T-shirts. They are stylish and come in many colors (I own about 12 different colors). The ONLY thing to know about them is that they wear out quickly (like 2 seasons). I wear mine a lot (7 months out of the year they are my main t-shirt), so they get washed a lot and quickly take on the faded (burn-out) look. It's a nice look up to a point, and then the shirts just look threadbare. But at $20-35 per shirt (depending on when I buy them) they are still a great deal if they last only 2 years. The fabrics vary from color to color, even though you'd think they are all made of the same stuff. For instance, the ""white"" color clearly has more cotton in the blend and will last longer. Some colors, seemingly randomly, last longer than others. But again, they ALL look great when new and I get compliments on them all the time. Several of my male friends have pretty much abandoned their old t-shirts in favor of a collection of the Venice Burn-out shirts. I sure I'll be buying more of them!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 16 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"46","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","S. Harper","The cut of these shirts makes it look like I bought them on purpose, for the fit. Which I did. I bought one, loved the way it fit, and went back to buy 4 more in different colors. Great purchase.I'm 6'1, 215 with what clothing companies would call an ""Athletic build,"" Meaning I'm a big guy with broad shoulders, but not significantly overweight (maybe 10 pounds over, which for my body type isn't very much.) Most T-shirts for around $20 don't fit me very well. XL is usually too big, hanging like curtains below my shoulders. And L is generally right on the edge for me. If I'm 10 pounds over my normal, as I am right now (and likely will be for the foreseeable future), a size Large will be too tight across my chest.The wrong fit can really make me look bad by adding perceived weight, while the right fit usually brings a lot of ""Hey, did you lose weight?"" questions.These shirts, in an XL are perfect for me. Big enough to fit my shoulders, tapering a little bit in across my 'not bad' torso.  Well worth the extra money. Love them.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 October 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"50","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","Samuel Mathews","I’ll start with the cons. After a few washes, the shirts pile up. (Tiny little cotton balls that pile up everywhere on the shirt) the colors do indeed fade, but who cares, it still looks good. I hardly ever gotten compliments on shirts but I did with these shirts but I didn’t get the shirts for that reason. They are very comfortable and have a great fit. Especially if you’re in the slightly athletic and up, build. Nice fit on the biceps. But not too tight, nice fit around the chest. It even accentuates your back quite well too. Look, they shirts are 20 bucks. Buy a couple colors you like, if you like them a lot, but one or two more of that same color and put them away for when they stop selling these shirts. They are worth the cons that everyone talks about.To make them last longer and keep their size. Never dry them using any heat, not even the delicate setting. I hang dry all of mine. I think air fluff dryer setting would work fine. Machine wash gentle. Even as they fade or “pile” up, they are still a much better looking shirt than any logo or solid color tee. Buy one! You’ll love it.True to size. Good length. I’m 6’4” 210, about a 40cm bicep. Sleeves are slightly snug on my arms for a nice look.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 December 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars"
