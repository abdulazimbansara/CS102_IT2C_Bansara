"7","Shorts","Lee Men's Dungarees New Belted Wyoming Cargo Short","Nathan","I had to read the comments thoroughly to know that the sizing is too small. I am normally a 36"" for all trousers/shorts but I had to buy 38"" and it just fits. Any smaller and I'd have to buy 40"".Overall the shorts are good quality and come with a belt.The groin pocket material feels a bit thin and could wear easily with a set of keys or something inside. Will probably use the side compartment only","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 11 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

They are starting to fade, but I think that‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs fault. I now wash them on delicate and will try to get another two years out of them.The pockets are just about perfect.

"14","Shorts","Lee Men's Dungarees New Belted Wyoming Cargo Short","Steve","I normally wear size 36 waist in everything. After reading a review that said these run small I ordered one size bigger at 38. It‚Äôs a good thing I did because size 38 fits perfect. A size 36 would‚Äôve definitely been too small. Other than that they‚Äôre great shorts for the price.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 23 June 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"16","Shorts","Lee Men's Dungarees New Belted Wyoming Cargo Short","DadZilla","Good looking shorts but the waist is on the tight side. If you are a bigger guy I would order a size up. The body of the shorts fit pretty much the same between the 36 and the 38 but  the waist was at least a size smaller than my other shorts. I can't speak to durability yet but I will say they are not as thick as I expected.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 24 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It is possible these particular ahorts were made tight, and another size 36 could possibly fit perfect.

"30","Shorts","Lee Men's Dungarees New Belted Wyoming Cargo Short","Doris","I get all husbands wardrobe from Amazon & this first pair of shorts I've ever ordered that was huge in size. Not sure how happen but we looked at size & it was 40 in waist. Always ordered 38's and all fit husband perfect. How we ended up with these big shorts we dont know. Husband didn't try on as soon as we got. We both purchased a new summer wardrobe. Which is lots of new shorts, shirts, tanks & blouses. Amazon I use alot for us & rarely we ever now come across not something that don't fit. Hung up & husband only picks shorts a couple times a week. Works long hours & 6 days a week. Time he decides to put these on, he asks me, what in world did I get. Really huge in size. More like a 44 because I say what about belt & use for home comfy. I came & looked at them. No way only word Huge! So I told him to late to return & the cost in shipping. Plus chances are not get size correct in this brand. So we donated to our charity","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 August 2018","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"34","Shorts","Lee Men's Dungarees New Belted Wyoming Cargo Short","C","Really comfortable shorts but it doesn't take much for them to start losing their coloring and fading.  And it's not a consistent color fade, you'll have darker areas and lighter areas across the shorts. I have these in 3 colors and the darker colors do it the most; I've yet to see it happen in the khaki color.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 30 August 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"43","Shorts","Lee Men's Dungarees New Belted Wyoming Cargo Short","Red Woodred","We have purchased a number of these shorts for my husband, and this time the fabric was WAY off, the style was even significantly different. Pockets are like women's verticle slash pockets, not the deep pockets they used to be. I suppose this is why they cover the model wearing the pair with a jacket, so you can't see them. The sizing isn't even consistent.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"49","Shorts","Lee Men's Dungarees New Belted Wyoming Cargo Short","SteveInFrisco","These shorts feel super soft and great against the skin. I like the look of them too. My complaints are that these are cut a little big so I had to return the first order and then order a size smaller. They also don't stay up on your waist since the fabric is so soft and the belt that comes with them doesn't really stay tight but slowly start to slip lose when you move around, especially if you have something heavier in your pockets like my Note 10+ phone which has some heft. I find myself pulling up the pants back to my waist and pulling the belt snug several times a day when running errands or working outside. It would be awesome if they added a non-slip waist band to these like my golf shorts have on the inside of the waist band. Also if the included belt had more grip texture so it would keep from slipping loose when you move around.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 November 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"
