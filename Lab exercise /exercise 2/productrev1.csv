"8","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Philip","I usually order a pack of these every 6 months or so to use as undershirts, workout shirts, or just lounge-around-at-home shirts. They're quite comfortable, good quality and fit me very well. That is until this latest pack - it seems that the fabric quality or thickness has been reduced as this last pack is too lightweight. So lightweight that the shirts are verging on 'sheer' and you can see through them while dry, let along when you add a hint of sweat. Im not confident that this latest batch will even last for the next 6 months which is a shame. I'll see how it goes and report back.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 22 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"26","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Adam","First wash after the HTV application and all looking good. I think the material is probably a tad on the thin size - but - for this price - they are great for newbies like me to practice with t-shirt HTV techniques.

"30","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Chris Morrison","Unfortunately not the ones I thought they were - as I sturdy have Fruit of the Loom Stay Tucked tees that have lasted through numerous washing cycles in the past year. Although the size was right, the fabric on these shirts was much less resilient, thin and transparent-like. For something that costs roughly US$ 6, they're definitely not worth GBP 20.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"35","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Agis F.","I love Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton white T-shirts. I have probably bought more than a hundred of them for the last 15 years, mainly as work undershirts. Also, at home, there‚Äôs nothing like wearing a 100% cotton, soft and comfy shirt for all seasons. I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts  from Amazon. It‚Äôs also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen. I ordered my usual medium size, only to realize I indeed should have listened to the previous reviewers. I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me ‚Äì the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can‚Äôt complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging ‚Äì I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 11 March 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"36","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Un cliente","The Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Crew T-Shirt is a comfortable and reliable choice for everyday wear. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 23 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"40","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Chris Morrison","This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"41","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","R Razak","Bought to put vinyl logo on for gym/team. Quality is not great. If you are looking for 100% cotton but not very thick, these would be ideal.

"46","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Cliente de Amazon","Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 30 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"47","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Cintia","These are comfortable shirts, nice and soft, and I like them because of their length.
