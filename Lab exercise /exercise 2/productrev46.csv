"6","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","Eplag","I've been buying Large size shorts and other pants for 30 years. The unstretched dimensions are ok, but the elastic stretches far too easily and almost doubles in size! I'm not that kind of build, so while they seem great quality for the price, you need to be quite large for these shorts not to slip down...as for using the pockets...this could be quite embarrassing with a mobile phone and or wallet! The drawstring is interesting - it is a loop, and may need to be cut to be able to be tied in a bow. I'd probably be ok with the next size down but don't get the option to exchange online so I returned these shorts for a refund.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 19 July 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"7","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","kk","These shorts have convinced me not to buy any more items from an American dealer. I bought a large size, which I am normally in Australia and I am practically swimming in these shorts. The length comes WELL below the knee and I look like such a geek in them.I suspect I should have gone a small size. Which to me is absurd. American men must be giants.The fabric is alright; not great. The pockets are not sewn into place and kinda flop around which is annoying.I think I'm going to use them as pyjama pants tbh.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 12 February 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"8","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","Kindle Customer","Massively over sized. Return policy for international means I'd have to pay more to have it returned that it cost me to buy. So I'm stuck with clown shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 September 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"11","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","Vanessa Pike-Russell","Pathetic quality of the product. Seemed to be fake item. Cannot even return it as it would cost more to ship than the actual price. Worst experience with Amazon","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 21 November 2018","4.3 out of 5 stars"
"12","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","Eplag","These cotton shorts are super light and breathable so they're perfect to sleep in or wear around the house.  As all the reviews say they run bigger than the sizing chart would suggest. By the chart I should be L but I got M and it was the perfect size, so go a size down- you'll feel good about yourself too in the illusion that you've lost weight.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 4 January 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"15","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","catman","These shorts are comfortable. Better still, they're sized correctly. I've had problems with discounted clothing because it was sized according to Asian standards.The only improvement I could suggest is that there were more colours to choose from.I use these shorts for pajama bottoms in the summer months. Because they have pockets, I can wear them as shorts during the day. So I get a lot of use out of them.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 8 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"19","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","BigGuy","OK as a basic pair of gym shorts.  But waistband elastic is rather loosem which means you can't really have anything in your pockets or the shorts will sag.  The material is rather rough to the touch, but that may soften with use.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Singapore on 28 December 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"34","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","LAWRENCE J BAKER","The size of the shorts seems to be correct but the elastic around the waist is too loose.Edit:  The fabric is so thin and flimsy.  Even with a set of keys and my phone in the pockets the short flop around.  Poor quality.  I downgraded this from 3 stars to 1 star.  Will not buy again.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"35","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","Obdulia E.","These shorts are great for lounging around the house, and for wearing to bed, especially if you don't like sleeping in long sweats/pajamas.I don't recommend these for the gym or really any outdoor activity due to the style and thin-fabric: They're really just too casual of a style for more than lounging. That's just my opinion, of course, so if you're the type of dude to wear old, ratty, grey sweats, or worn-out t-shirts with the sleeves personally cut-off, out in public -by all means, knock yourself out!I've had several pairs of these over the last decade, and they're my go-to sleep-shorts. All of my original purchases were at Sports Authority, then 2 from Amazon within the last year.Although they are pretty lightweight and soft, the shorts are comparatively quite durable, as none of mine have ever worn through or come apart -- I just seem to lose a pair every couple of years, on a trip or at a hotel stay, then re-purchase.  The current shorts' material is approximately the same as my originals, but the stitching around the waistband is much less detailed, and frankly looks a bit sloppy.  The older shorts had very detailed, sturdy, and useful stitching around the waist and drawstring-area -I've attached some pics for comparison.  My recent purchase had long strands of excess thread dangling from some of the stitching.  I had to trim all of this off, in lieu of better quality control at the factory or by the distributor.The inner tag is still annoyingly sewn into the vertical seam right at the top of your tailbone (butt-crack, to be crass), so I just carefully cut it out before the first laundering.I'm not a fan of logos -- but for information's sake, the logo used to be embroidered onto the leg and now it's simply silkscreened-on.The fit is ""as-expected"".I'm not super-happy with the waistband change or the loose thread everywhere, but I got my recent pair for half-off during prime-day, so -Score!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 16 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I work in a pharmaceutical testing lab and this smelled pretty bad, almost like a very bad woods fire, not a dye thing.  I would advise the seller to notify the responsible party to rectify this. There is no telling what I was exposed too.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 28 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"46","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Cotton Baseline Short with Pockets","James K. Ponton","I'm a pretty big guy, some might say fat even, whatever, can't hurt my feelings! It's hard to find a pair of comfy shorts that fit right and don't look like short shorts or daisy dukes and these are it! I typically wear a 4x and when I opened these up I thought they were a 5x they looked huge but I tried them on and they fit great, finally a pair of comfy shorts that come down over the knee that don't cost an arm and a leg. Only 3 stars because they aren't super soft as 100% cotton should be but maybe they'll soften up after a few more washings.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 20 November 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I would say the sizing is accurate.  They are fairly low quality - but you get what you pay for in most cases.  Washed and dried well.  Time will tell for longevity.
