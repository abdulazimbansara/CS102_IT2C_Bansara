"6","T-shirt","Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirts for Men Odor Resistance Base Layer Lightweight Hiking Travel T-Shirt Soft Undershirt","Tim","When I saw the price and the review of this Merino Protect shirt, I had to try it!  I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of Merino Protect's shirts. I now have 3 of them.  I'm a big fan of 100% merino wool - I commute by bicycle in NYC, and I prefer to wear 100% merino in all seasons.  Many other manufacturers have taken to blending their merino with man-made fibers, which detracts from the quality and experince.  This short sleeve model does a great job - the material is really soft and wicks sweat wonderfully. The length is perfect; it's a bit longer than a typical cotton T-shirt, which makes it just right for cycling.  I'm 5'8"", 170lb, and the medium fits me beautifully - stays close to my skin for wicking, without being too snug.I wanted to wait until I washed them a few times before writing this review, and I can tell you my Merino Protect shirts are holding up great and are as soft as new.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 December 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars"

His assortment of current shirts was sad and nothing that dried quick and kept him dry.  This Merino T-Shirt was perfect.  He is an X-L and it fit him perfect.  He looked great and he said was very comfortable.  We had use of a washer while in Sicily so he washed his shirts and let them dry on the rack.  At first it had a funny smell and I thought it was the washer sheets I had bought for the trip and was thinking I needed to rewash.  But by the time the shirts dried, all smell was gone and they were great.  They dried very quickly even on a shaded balcony.  This shirt takes up basically no room in the suitcase and since we did carry on only - this was very important.  Great product!!

I also use it as a daily base layer under casual shirts and hoodies. Washes fine on a short, cold machine wash on the ‘wool’ setting and dries quickly.

I have several merino wool long sleeve base layer shirts that I love for outdoors activities in winter (costing $80-120) but wanted short sleeve merino wool shirts for warmer weather and specifically for travel as they are light, soft & comfortable and don't hold body odor.  But check the prices of several top name brands.  So for $34 I took a chance and this is a solid shirt.  Merino wool T-shirts are not meant to be 'heavy'.  And 100% merino is not that strong and often is blended w polyester for strength.  So some care is required.  I purchased an XL, which is a bit tight.  There is some mild shrinkage if you don't wash in cold water and if you put it in a dryer, low heat for just a few minutes then lay flat to finish.  I liked the shirt so much I purchased 2 more in XXL and they are perfect at this price point.  Packaging was on point and no tears, holes or design flaws in the shirts.  I have washed these a couple of times now and they are wearing great.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 March 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars"

My experience with Merino wool has always been positive in terms of its benefits and comfort. Recently, I decided to expand my travel wardrobe and purchased the Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirt, as well as a slightly less expensive option from MERINNOVATION.Though I haven't had the opportunity to put these shirts to the test during my travels yet, I couldn't resist trying them out during scorching 100-degree weather. The results were impressive! Among the Merino Wool Protect, MERINNOVATION, and regular cotton t-shirts, the Merino Wool Protect shirt stood out. Its design seemed to prioritize ventilation, allowing me to feel surprisingly cool despite the intense heat. In contrast, the MERINNOVATION shirt felt notably hotter than even the regular cotton tee, which was quite unexpected.I can't help but wonder if the variance in merino wool blends between these two shirts contributed to the significant difference in comfort levels. Regardless, the Merino Wool Protect shirt unquestionably emerged as the winner in this comparison. The superior cooling effect it provided was a game-changer, making it an obvious choice for my upcoming travels.Unfortunately, the MERINNOVATION shirt didn't live up to expectations and was promptly returned. It's clear to me that the Merino Wool Protect shirt is the real deal, offering both the benefits of merino wool and a thoughtfully engineered design for ventilation.While I'm eagerly awaiting the chance to put these shirts through their paces during actual travel scenarios, my initial experience with the Merino Wool Protect shirt leaves me optimistic and impressed. Its cooling performance and comfortable fit have already won me over. I can't wait to see how it performs on my next adventure!Pros:Impressive cooling performance even in extreme heatComfortable fit and designClear distinction from less effective alternatives like MERINNOVATIONCons:Limited testing opportunity so farOverall, highly recommended for anyone seeking quality merino wool clothing that truly delivers on comfort and cooling capabilities!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"23","T-shirt","Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirts for Men Odor Resistance Base Layer Lightweight Hiking Travel T-Shirt Soft Undershirt","JC","Good merino wool t-shirts like this are worth every penny. Beware of cheap ones that say ""merino wool"" and are actually spandex with a percentage of Merino that needs more than one digit of accuracy to show up.This was a well-made t-shirt at a very competitive price-point, that feels like wool. It's slightly scratchy to the touch compared to cotton, yet not ""rough"". You could not be faulted for thinking it's going to be itchy when you first feel it with your hands. But once it's on your body, it feels great: it regulates temperature beautifully without ever feeling suffocating, and coddles you unobtrusively. It stretches a surprising amount. And surprisingly for the weight, it does not collect body odor, and dries quite quickly when you wash it.As I mentioned in the title, I guffawed at the price, but once I tried it, I went back and bought some more, and since I bought them, I have worn no other t-shirts. I have thrown on a cotton t-shirt now & again, but every time, the entire time I'm wearing cotton I'm wondering ""why am I not wearing the nice t-shirts?""Update: a few months later, after these were not available for a while, I was so happy to see them back that decided to go all-in and buy 4 more. Sadly, their sizing and the thickness of the material have changed and not for the better.I will give them credit for feeling OK otherwise, but the L that fit perfectly before now feels thinner and sort of sloppy, esp. around the neck. Basically, they must be subcontracting the actual manufacturer, and the new maker went looser on the pattern. Not at all happy to have spent over $200 on 4 t-shirts that are lower quality, and not what I bought before, and they really *should* have announced in bold that the fit is completely different now, but still for someone in the 210/5'10 to 250-6'3 range the L should be a good fit now.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 September 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Well, I was wrong! I like them, and they seemed to be of just as good quality and fairly similar thickness of other high quality merino wool t-shirts. I am big on merino wool person, and having trekked over 12,000 miles in the last six years, always wear merino wool as a base layer and top layer. I also use merino wool clothing for everyday wear. I have many of the top brands, Meriwool, Merino.tech, Minus33, Woolly, Smartwool, Burton, and my favorite, Icebreaker. I have found over the years that most of clothing from the brand names companies are of fairly similar overall good quality, and now Merino Protect will be up there with merino wool clothing I’ll buy.The material definitely is wool, and if you’ve worn merino before, you’d notice that right away and not mistake it for any other material. The collar is not overly loose like many cheap t-shirts, and the stitching appears well made. I am 6’1” and was concerned with some of the reviews that noted it was short. I ordered x-large and it fits me well as I am about 195 lbs. If you are bigger, you might be out of luck. For me, before it was washed, it hung well below my belt, and almost to my crotch, plenty long for me. However, the sleeves seemed fairly short, but that is the style with most t-shirts, and I just like them long like the old traditional t-shirts.I have read several reviewers state that they thought this material was thin, and even cheap. To me it seems that these might be around 160-170 gm of merino wool, fairly standard for light to mid weight wool t-shirts. They are definitely not thin! Compared to cotton for sure, but if you’ve never worn merino wool as an all around t-shirt, you might not know that this thickness and feel is typical of all merino wool t-shirts.I bought three black and one camo, and I am surprised and very pleased with the quality, and plan to buy several more for this price! I bought a lot of Merino.tech t-shirts when they first came out because they were price below everyone else because they were new. Now they are up there in price with all the other merino wool t-shirts, and maybe that’s why these are so very reasonably priced for a very good quality merino wool t-shirt. I’d say, get these at this price while you can.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 20 May 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I wore them alternating days.  In Mexico November is pretty cold in the day and hot in the middle of the day.  It kept me warm in the morning when it was cold and in the afternoon walking all over the city the weather was warm and even hot.  I did sweat during the day and came back to the hotel without a smell.  I hang the shirt up in the closet and use the other one the next day.  Went hiking to the Pyramid in Mexico with a hot weather.  Sweat like crazy and came back to the hotel at night and shirt did not smell.  I did wash the shirt once due to some food spill.  My vacation was 15 days.  When I finally got back home, I wash them properly with mild soap and let it hand dried.  Seal it in a plastic bag to avoid moth from eating your shirt.

"27","T-shirt","Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirts for Men Odor Resistance Base Layer Lightweight Hiking Travel T-Shirt Soft Undershirt","jcsxyz2005","Having never experienced desert conditions, prior to a recent trip attending a wedding in Saudi Arabia I researched t-shirts that scored highest with respect to keeping cool. This compelled me to perform an experiment by purchasing two different highest-scoring wool t-shirt brands (because wool as a cooling solution simply seemed counterintuitive to me).  Here’s my review for this Merino Protect base layer t-shirt.First, and foremost, I’ll start at the end and point out this shirt was not only the lower-priced of the two, the other shirt’s price skyrocketed from $47 at the time of the purchase to now (only a month later) $74 while (at the time of this review) this Merino Protect shirt is still available at $38 and is a best deal in my humble opinion. And that leads to point number 2:Yes, cotton and polyester t-shirts are easily available at half the price or less. However, I could never have worn a cotton or polyester t-shirt after walking around in Saudi Arabian afternoon sun without an odorous finish. Amazingly, this wasn’t this case for either of these two wool shirts purchased and tested on this wedding trip. In fact, that afternoon walk was the day after having worn this shirt as my base layer during the entire 20 travel hours of driving, flight, and layover time. Even my wife exclaimed surprise at how the shirt remained nearly odorless at the end of the second day in the Saudi sun.Benefit #3 is how well this shirt keeps its shape. After hand washing both and placing both on hangers to dry, the other higher-priced shirt ended up with a stretched shoulder on one side. This Merino Protect held up just fine. Lesson learned, BTW, as I now lay these flat to dry (hangers not recommended).My only complaint has much to do with why my wife calls me “dangerous” when eating. Something liquidy landed on this shirt (gray color) and though I initially drenched the dime-sized spot with water and then a couple of hours later hand washed the shirt with extra emphasis on the stain spot, an echo of the spot remains. So what did I do as a result? I just placed two more of these shirts on my wish list promising my wife never to eat while wearing them without also wearing a bib.Wool is now my hot weather solution from now on. Who would have thunk it?","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 8 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

What I dislike about the product is the thinness. Ideally, it should be a little thicker, like a regular cotton t shirt. It is apparent that the company tried to use the least amount of fabric as possible to keep down the costs, but at the same time that is the only way to be affordable. All in all, I would say the thinness is still passable, and I can feel the good quality.

Not a big deal, but it's very lightweight-- it would last longer if the material were a little more substantial.The neck opening is so small! I like my shirts loose fitting, so I sized up to a men's large. I am a medium-sized woman (5'4"" and 130 lbs) and the neck is cut very high on me. I think it would be too tight on the size man this is meant for. And the inside of the neck is an overlocked seam-- it's not smooth.

I’ll NEVER use polyester for something like that again. Wool is the way to go—like I said, wore it every day, sweated it up, dried it overnight, maybe rinsed it a couple times, it did not stink up one bit.This T is half as expensive as that big-name-branded one. Why? This one has fewer panels, so it’s more of an ordinary fit, probably a good thing when you’ve bulked up a bit since your last trip. It fits just like a size Large T meant for the outdoors should: trim, for me at 6’1” (now) 200 lbs, a size L in all US outdoor brands my whole adult life. Other than the additional panels for a slightly better/trimmer fit and the logo, I don’t see why the other T I used would cost double. The seams on this one all appear to be well done.I immediately threw this on and did a little biking to bouldering nearby. Worked up a sweat on a nice December day in NYC around 50 degrees. This T was PERFECT. Cotton would have been horrible, polyester smelly. I feel like wool somehow draws the stink away from the body and evaporates it, while polyesters only bake it in. You don’t do 21 straight days in the same polyester T shirt…Anyhow, this one has a perfect weight to it, about the same as a cotton T but thicker than your average polyester workout T.Bottom line: great product, I’ll probably buy more.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 31 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"44","T-shirt","Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirts for Men Odor Resistance Base Layer Lightweight Hiking Travel T-Shirt Soft Undershirt","Daddy Dav","I bought this six weeks ago, wore it a few days on a trip to Europe (with a couple of sweaty days) and have worn it off and on since then, including a five-day stretch under a cotton, long-sleeve T-shirt. I'm wearing it again today by itself and if someone didn't know all I just said that person would think I had just taken it out of the packaging and put it on for the first time -- no smell (as many others have noted about Merino) and no wrinkles either! It's got an elegant look too, a cut above cotton T's, and it's soft to the touch.I imagine on another vacation trip I could probably wear this one shirt for a week or more; and maybe pack a second one just in case I might like to rinse this one and let it dry for a day. I haven't tried to wash it yet but I have to say I love it so far. If I didn't already have drawers full of cotton T's and polo shirts I'd buy a two more of these and wear them exclusively.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"48","T-shirt","Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirts for Men Odor Resistance Base Layer Lightweight Hiking Travel T-Shirt Soft Undershirt","Customer","This shirt seems to live up to the claimed benefits of warding off odor, feeling good for the temperature (in warm or cool weather), but I think it might cause very slight itchiness for me. Maybe my skin is just slightly sensitive. I don't know if all Merino wool shirts would be the same for me. Not sure I could wear it as a baselayer on an all day hike or something like that. Like it a lot overall. The fit seems true to size, roomy. Holding its shape so far after one gentle wash (no tumble dry). Like the look, too.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 20 May 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"50","T-shirt","Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirts for Men Odor Resistance Base Layer Lightweight Hiking Travel T-Shirt Soft Undershirt","RW","I did read some reviewers saying that it itches and there's a coating. I was hoping the reviewers were hyper sensitive. So either I'm hyper sensitive too or it's just plain itchy t-shirt.As for the coating. There's no need for that. When you hand wash it, the water just bead off and you had to really soak it 100%. It was like it was sprayed with Scott Guard or something. So now, I just hand wash it again with dishwasher soap and drying on the coat hanger overnight hoping the itching will go away. I won't know until tomorrow when I test it again.I ordered size large and fit well. The neck is tighter than normal but not really tight. It really trap the heat in.The cloth is thin. I'm not saying it's good or bad. Just be aware of it and depending on your needs.I hand wash in cold water both time.About the itchy part. I did wear it for one day and I was aware of the itching but not enough to drive me nuts. Well, for the most part. LOLI just wish it was 100% soft and itch free.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 6 May 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
