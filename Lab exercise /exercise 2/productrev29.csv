"1","Shorts","ZENGVEE 3 Pack Men's Compression Shorts Cool Dry Running Base Layer Shorts with Phone Pockets for Running,Training, Workout, Gym","Tim Mullins","I have had many bad fit experiences, but these have been great especially at the price.  I find many others the waistband cuts into you and can roll which makes it worse.  These do neither of those things.  Super comfortable.  Have not had the product long enough to speak to quality over time.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 26 October 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars"
"2","Shorts","ZENGVEE 3 Pack Men's Compression Shorts Cool Dry Running Base Layer Shorts with Phone Pockets for Running,Training, Workout, Gym","Brent","In some colourways the amazon images show a sizing chart. ignore that entirely as it is wrong and just get what size you would normally wear. The shaping isn't perfect for me but it's fine and the price is ok. They're comfortable all day, for hours of walking etc. and prevent chafing.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 22 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"10","Shorts","ZENGVEE 3 Pack Men's Compression Shorts Cool Dry Running Base Layer Shorts with Phone Pockets for Running,Training, Workout, Gym","John Mostyn","I'm not sure what everyone was on about with the size being correct, but I have a 31 inch waist which would make me an XL in their sizing guide. I wanted them to be tight fitting so I ordered L thinking it should work, but they are wayyyyy too big. I should have just gone with my normal sizing instead of following their guide. So now I'm stuck with them since they came from Amazon US to Amazon AU, paying an extra $20 for quick shipping, and for me to return them it will cost me another $24 in shipping! So basically I've spent twice the amount of the actual item, and they are unusable. Don't waste your money!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 21 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"15","Shorts","ZENGVEE 3 Pack Men's Compression Shorts Cool Dry Running Base Layer Shorts with Phone Pockets for Running,Training, Workout, Gym","Robert Sette","These are great semi-compression shorts.  Why do I say ""semi-compression"" you ask?  Well, real compression shorts are expensive, around $30 and up per pair.  Too pricey to have enough to wear daily.I have dysautonomia from Covid, and it really has turned my life upside down.  Blood pressure and flow to limbs is affected.  My doctor suggested I wear compression socks and underwear to help with blood flow issues.I purchased 3 different brands to see which were the best.  I bought these (Zengvee), Telaleo, and Niksa, all from Amazon.  The Zengvee are definitely my favorite. While all three are the same length (see picture), the other 2 brands were more high-waisted than the Zengvee, making the Zengvee effectively longer on my legs.  The other 2 brands tend to have a waistband that rolls.  The Zengvee waistband didn't roll, and seem to be a bit thicker than the other 2 brands.  After several months of wearing them, the Zengvee are the definite winner.  They are comfortably snug as expected without being uncomfortable.One side note; when I bought them, all 3 brands claimed to be 85% polyester and 15% spandex.  Since I need compression to regulate my blood pressure, I assumed more spandex would equal more compression.  Unfortunately, of the 3 brands I bought, only the Telaleo were actually 15% spandex, even though all 3 brands are advertised as 15% spandex.  I don't notice a difference in the actual compression while wearing them, but was annoyed at the deceptive marketing claims.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 29 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The compression shorts are great value for money. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù with a 36‚Äù waist so followed the size guide and bought size L. The fit is good. One minor observation is make sure your over shorts have a drawstring. My medium sized thighs (24‚Äù/61cm circ) play tug of war with the waist band and two thighs is no match for one waist. I can fit my iPhone 13 in the pocket with ease.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
