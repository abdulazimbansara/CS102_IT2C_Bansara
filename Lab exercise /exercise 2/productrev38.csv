"3","Shorts","Volcom","Chris Hetrick","I‚Äôve owned a few pairs of these.  They fit well, perfect length, and I am tall ( 6‚Äô2) so that‚Äôs not always easy to find.  I‚Äôve gone through a few pairs and they wear out like any item of clothes you would wear frequently, but they‚Äôre just about the best shorts I can find.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 August 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"6","Shorts","Volcom","Anthony Pavlich","These shorts look nice. not too long or short. Great pocket space, with a slot so my phone can sit upright and not fall sideways while I'm walking. I work at a golf shop and these sorts look great with all of the nice shirts that I wear at work, and they look cool with a T-shirt when I get home and hangout with my friends.  I've always loved Volcom products. Quality style.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 August 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"8","Shorts","Volcom","Nicholas Parker","Right off the bat, let's talk color. I was looking at the burnt sienna for a while but I was worried that they were going to be too orange and/or too bright. They aren't. The product photo is pretty close to what you get. In bright light like in the photo of me wearing them, they do appear lighter but it's not obnoxious.I would refer to these more as burgundy than orange but color perception can be variable across people.I am not the kind of person who wears bright colored shorts that stand out. My other shorts are tan, light grey, dark gray, khaki... These burnt sienna shorts are on the edge of my comfort zone but I really like them!As for the shorts themselves, I love them. I already have several other pairs of Volcom shorts. They are casual but look polished. The length falls at my knee (I'm 6 feet tall). They have a slightly slim cut so they aren't baggy. Deep front pockets. Normal back pockets, no button closure.(they are wrinkly on me because I put them on straight out of the bag)","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 July 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"21","Shorts","Volcom","Kim Weldon","My husband is over the moon about these shorts.  We first got a pair at Ross (much cheaper) but the only pair they had.  He wanted me to order more, so I did.  They are casual without being so over casual like cargo shorts.  He wants me to throw all of those away.  These fit amazing without the legs being so big.  I ordered 2 more pairs and will probably order more.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 May 2019","4.6 out of 5 stars"

"23","Shorts","Volcom","Holden McMurphy","I have had several pairs of these Volcom shirts, they're my go to shorts for the summer.  I purchased this pair because the description said modern fit.  I expected the 20 inch outseam, and a somewhat fitted leg.In my picture I placed my usual Volcom shirts and this pair side by side.  The outseam is 22 inches on the new pair compared to the 20 inches on my usual Volcom shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 June 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars"

I actually get a lot of compliments on these shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 23 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"34","Shorts","Volcom","Will","Just what I was looking for. Perfect fit, comfortable, good length, cool color. I'll buy 1-2 more pairs.Update: I ordered two more pairs, one in khaki and the other in blue. The blue pair came in a little snugger than my original purchase, which actually worked out even better for me, but the khaki pair were looser and droopy. I doubt I will wear those much at all. That was a disappointment.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 16 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"41","Shorts","Volcom","Lafe","Can‚Äôt keep them looking nice. They come out of the dryer covered in lint. Clean them up and an hour later they are covered in hair and more lint.

I am on the large 36 small 38. I ordered 36 and they fit amazing. No belt needed. Not too tight either. Order them!The only CON, as with all the newer Vilcom shorts is there isn‚Äôt a cell phone pocket or slash pocket.
