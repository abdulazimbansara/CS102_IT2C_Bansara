"8","T-shirt","Dickies Men's Heavyweight Crew Neck Short Sleeve Tee","Dan","Own a few Dickies pocket tees and ordered a size up as I’d added a bit of muscle. Fit is quite boxy (as expected) and material is definitely more heavyweight than my other dickies pocket tees.Did not experience any shrinking after first wash and dry cycle (might be because I choose delicate setting)Love the earthy colour, I’ve bought worse tshirts at this price point. Bargain!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 September 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"30","T-shirt","Dickies Men's Heavyweight Crew Neck Short Sleeve Tee","D. G. SMITH","My husband owns this in 5 different colours.  He’s 6’1, 225lbs and a regular 2xl is too wide for him, but the length is good.  A regular xl is not long enough buts fits otherwise.  So for him the only properly fitting T-shirt has to be an Xl T and not many places have them and if they do the colours are not for him.  So this has been a life saver.",NA,"Reviewed in Canada on 3 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
