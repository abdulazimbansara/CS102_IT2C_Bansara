"8","Shorts","Wrangler","Rayman","This cargo shorts is the best one I bought so far compared to all other brands. It is lightweight and soft compared to other brands that feels heavy when worn. It is true to its size and love that sizes have odd number options 29, 31, 33 unlike other brands which only has even number sizes e.g. 32, 34, 36 etc. It fits exactly as I want it to be. The additional pockets are so great to have that you can use and forget carrying a small bag in some occasions. The delivery was swift and courier was courteous enough to let me know it's delivered. Overall I am satisfied and thank you seller for the best service! I recommend this to all cargo short fanatics out there!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Singapore on 1 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"14","Shorts","Wrangler","Alicia F.","Quality is what you would expect from Wrangler - pretty good. Fits true to size. We ordered the bullfrog colour though, and it's more grey and much less green than in the photo.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 15 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"15","Shorts","Wrangler","Amazon Customer","I like these shorts, they are loose, but not baggy. I ordered a 36, and they fit me very well. Ample pockets for wallet, phone, keys and loose change. The colors I ordered were perfect, I ordered the grey/white camo pattern as well as the Camel, which is khaki. I did send one pair back to be replaced becasue the zipper stuck, I certainly don't think that's becasue of lack of quality, it some times happens, but these shorts are built very well but aren't too thick and heavy. I will definitely buy another pair as they represent solid value for the purchasing dollar.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 13 July 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"16","Shorts","Wrangler","Guido Martini","I needed to replace a pair of shorts for manual work. The fabric is very strong for wear and tear. Pockets are useful for the odd tools and fasteners.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 4 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"17","Shorts","Wrangler","Olivier","Those shorts are decent, the only thing I hate is that the back pockets have velcro and most of the time when I sit the velcro ""opens"" and later my shirt sticks to it, which is annoying.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 22 September 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"25","Shorts","Wrangler","RiiDeemed","I've always had Wrangler products in the past (mostly jeans) but I've come across a few of their cargo shorts.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this pair of pants as I've had bad experiences in the past with older companies going ""cheap"" and sacrificing quality for the sake of better margins (i.e. Levi's).This pair of pants definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, comfort and style!  It fit very snug and the premium twill is worth the extra $ and the pricing is still competitive enough to consider this a bargain.  I was expecting a bit more ""padding"" in terms of the material used as it is a bit thinner compared to previous pants I've worn from Wrangler.  It doesn't seem like it will wear out quickly so maybe the thinner material was done on purpose to help with comfort in the heat.  I've owned these for about 3 years now and they are still going strong!  Finally made the time to review these.  Will consider buying more of these in the future!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 9 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"36","Shorts","Wrangler","cosmicdust","Really nice shorts,  Velcro pockets and lots of them.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars are the cellphone pockets.  You might tightly squeeze in some of the newer phones without a protective case but, for sure, I can't get mine in and I just have a protective case that does not cover the screen.  Even if I could try to get it into the pocket with a lot of effort it would be a time consuming process to remove it.  Older phones (real old ones) might fit.  Mine is 3 years old and it doesn't fit!There are 3 horizontal ""phone"" pockets with velcro flap closures- phone won't fit in any of them.It needs one VERTICAL pocket big enough for phones.  Vertical would also match the contour of your leg.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 30 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
