"6","T-shirt","UNDER ARMOUR Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt","Thomas Hsu","I am 5' 8"" 195 lbs fat strong build. As in I'm not lean whatsoever but also have decently developed muscles. These shirts are awesome I own 5 of them. They really hide your gut while making your traps and shoulders look well developed. I like my shirts fitted and for my build they are exactly that while not making me look fat. It probably helps that I wear compression shirts under these. They are light and wick sweat fast. The only complaint I have is that they might not be very durable. So far they are not falling apart and I wash them pretty often but I will update this if they do start falling apart. But for the price I cant complain and wont dock a star. If you're a shorter stocky guy but not fat these are the shirt for you.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 4 July 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars"

The moisture-wicking fabric keeps you cool and dry during workouts, and the fit is comfortable without being too loose or tight. It's a versatile addition to your activewear collection, perfect for the gym or casual wear. The brand's logo adds a subtle touch of sporty appeal. Overall, a solid choice for those seeking quality and comfort in a short sleeve shirt.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I do a lot of long-distance trail running/hiking. I sweat, A LOT! These two shirts are the only ones that haven't developed that well-known gym funk (yet).For the price, they are simply impossible to beat. I got the long and am glad I did. I am about 6ft and think the regular length, for a large, would have been just a bit shorter than I would want.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"20","T-shirt","UNDER ARMOUR Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt","Porkchop","Absolute garbage that isn't fit to wipe your behind. I had an older Under Armor workout shirt that finally needed to be retired and thought I would be getting the same quality. No such luck. The fabric is incredibly thin and sticks to your body uncomfortably. The seams are unfinished and very scratchy. The neck opening is three times as big as it should be so you put on the shirt and you look a mess. It's garbage, I wouldn't wear this if they paid me to. I'd rather wear Hefty bag.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"33","T-shirt","UNDER ARMOUR Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt","Brian P","Love this shirt!  Very well made and highly recommend this!  As for sizing, I’m a big guy and am in-between a 3xl and 4xl.  Most 3xls are snug in me and some 4xls are a bit big on me.  I bought this in a 4xl and it fits as I figured it would…slightly on the snug side (smaller than a 4xl but a tiny bit bigger than a 3xl which works for me.  I’d say it is closer to a 3xl fit wise than a 4xl or somewhere in between.  Great shirt tho!!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"34","T-shirt","UNDER ARMOUR Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt","BigTwinRider1964","I normally buy 3XLT or 4X/4xlt tees.. I am 6'0"", 290-300#, with a 30 inch inseam, so I'm short legged and very long torsoed. Given my girth and long body, I require a tall length otherwise my underbelly will show. NOBODY wants to see that.  This shirt fits me perfectly. I've got some pretty big  arms and the sleeves don't bind. The neck hole is just the right size, and I can reach up without exposing my gut. I am a bit older, I have grey chest hair, which a few random strands frequently poke through. That doesn't bother me. It's a work shirt. I'm not going to a celebrity gala function wearing this. I wish it did have a chest pocket. For pens, cards, earbuds, etc. But that's my only complaint. It's a good shirt. I'd buy again.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I am 6'3"" and was getting a little frustrated with the shirt length which was shorter than I prefer and exposed my backside when bending over.  I then found these in tall sizes on Amazon am now 100% pleased with the fit.  The tall sizes are approximately 2 inches longer and are perfect for taller guys - Thank you UA and Amazon!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 15 February 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"
