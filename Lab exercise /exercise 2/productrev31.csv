"3","Shorts","Champion Men's Long Mesh","Tracey","I like them cause they are light weight and i'm 5'9, 80kgs and they seem to be a perfect fit, wearing them on hot days my legs don't get sweaty , inside of the pockets arn't great keys and wallet get tangled (keys in mesh! ) , apart from that so far so good. I also don't like the drawstring, seems too long and need too many knots.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 5 January 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"4","Shorts","Champion Men's Long Mesh","Ricky Smith","Best quality I've seen for the money by a long way. These are as perfect for playing Ball. I ordered 2 more pairs as soon as the 1st pair arrived. I saw similar products are over $100 retail and arguably not as good quality. Thank you to the seller for the great quality shorts and fast shipping. PS I am confident in spotting knock offs and these appear to be legit made by Hanes Brand who own Champion, just fyi.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 14 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"33","Shorts","Champion Men's Long Mesh","Amazon Customer","Name-brand shorts at about 1/2 the price as store-bought. Perfect length for sports--almost to the knee. The polyester mesh fabric is soft and smooth.

"49","Shorts","Champion Men's Long Mesh","SK","Five-star review, but let me get some of the downsides out of the way for those who might consider these downsides:1) They are mesh gym shorts. Because of that, they do have a little bit of a see-through effect. So don't be surprised if you buy the white ones and you go out wearing them and people can tell what color underwear you're wearing. (Protip: Wear underwear.)2) I've bought these in multiple colors. They are all true-to-size, excepting that the default ""athletic gray"" one seems to fit a little more snugly. (It also doesn't have the little split on the side of the leg, which makes me wonder if I was delivered the wrong thing on that particular purchase; who knows?) So caveat emptor on the athletic-gray color. But the rest fit great.3) A couple of the colors on these may not look exactly like they do on your computer or phone screen, but for my taste they are even better. The Swiss Blue looks like a nice cheery blue without looking faded. The Team Gold looks like a rich golden color without being either faded or bright as a disco ball.That said:These are great. They are comfy. They are great for working out. They are great for lazing around eating potato chips on the couch. And they are great for doing Zoom calls so you can go casual out of sight while you're wearing a shirt and tie up top.I'm the kind of guy who, when I'm at home, likes to wear clothes that I don't have to think about and say to myself, ""Oh, yeah, I'm wearing clothes."" These pretty much hit the mark on that. These are now long-term fixtures of my stay-at-home wardrobe.FYI: The inseam on these goes just past my knees.For care: Just make sure you don't put these in the dryer too long or too hot. Consider putting them in the dryer on low, and then if they're still a little damp, hanging them to air dry the rest of the way.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Singapore on 17 June 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"50","Shorts","Champion Men's Long Mesh","SK","The shorts are good quality.  My son is 5'11"" and slim and the shorts fall above the knee and the small is a little too tight.  He wears them for gym class but going to order a medium for a more comfortable fit.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 July 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"
