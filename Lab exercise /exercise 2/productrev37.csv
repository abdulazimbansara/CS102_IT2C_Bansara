"25","Shorts","Nautica Men's Classic Fit Flat Front Stretch Solid Chino Deck Short","MADPWR","This review is for Nautica Men's Classic Fit Flat Front Stretch Solid Chino 8.5"" Deck Shorts.  I have them in both Khaki and Blue Indigo.  The colors look better than what is show in the listings, especially the blue indigo.  The material is very nice and comfortable.  The slight stretch adds to the fit and comfort.  These are also true to size.  The length ends just at the top of my knee cap.  The front pockets aren't very deep or shallow.  I was a little concerned that my wallet or large phone would drop out of the front pockets, but I have not had any issues.  Overall, these shorts are excellent, and I am very happy with them.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"46","Shorts","Nautica Men's Classic Fit Flat Front Stretch Solid Chino Deck Short","WhatAboutBob","During summer I live in these.  So far I have bought 4 of these shorts and all 4 are great.  The length is perfect, not too long and not too short, just above the knees.  The crotch area is very comfortable, when you sit your friends will not get crushed.  Pockets are nice and deep, I can fit my iPhone 13 Max comfortably and without having to constantly adjust and it doesn't leave a big imprint, even when i sit down the phone is not in the way.  I am 5'9"" and 180 Lbs athletic build and waist 35 fits me very well.  The cloth and workmanship is also good.  My plan is to eventually buy all the colors.  So the fit, the style, the cloth, the tailoring all combine to give you a relaxed summery shorts.  if you are looking for skinny fit tight shorts then don't get these.  Hope that was helpful.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
