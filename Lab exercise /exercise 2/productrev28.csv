"2","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","BunningsSnag","Excellent brand and quality. I’ve purchased a pair directly from dickies previously that fit perfectly. The problem is as has been 3 times now that when I’ve purchased size 40 inch shorts from overseas they have sent me 36 inch. Sent back first pair as they paid for postage. I received a full refund. I’m left with the second pair of carpenter denim shorts as it would cost me almost the price I paid for the shorts in postage back to the USA. Also I have a month to drop off this pair at a parcel return which is hard as the closest is 4-5 hours drive away. Bit of a scam really if you’re not from a major city that has a return facility. Be warned if you’re looking for larger sizes. I won’t be buying off here .","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 25 February 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"3","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","TIM H","Reading the reviews, and wanting them to be baggy like my other shorts from the 90's i ordered 2 sizes up.  Im 6ft and medium build usually a 36, so i ordered a 40.I received a 36, but the fit really well, they are the exact same size/shape as an old pair of size 38 from jayjays int he 2000's. Doesnt make any sense, but i am happy with the product i received.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 7 February 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"4","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","scott simpson","These are basicly the only shorts I own, work and play. They're tough and versatile, loose fitting with spacious pockets, I thrash these shorts and pants all day everyday and they handle the abuse well, do be warned when ordering your size, they're TIGHT when zipped and clipped, either order 1 size up or just warm wash and wear them in a bit. Other than that, amazing shorts. They're tight in a 34 but i can comfortably fit 36 in these","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"6","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","Jaxon","With Dickies, you play a lottery as to whether your purchase will fit. Sure, you may be a size 36, and own other dickies pants that are a size 36 that fit well, doesn't mean that your new size 36 purchase will fit. They are way too small, would be tight on a size 34 person.As it's an Amazon US purchase, if I opted to return the item and take out the return postage cost Amazon has set, I would be refunded 51cents.  Might as well try to flog them on ebay now.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 December 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Some other reviewers said that they do come up small, but I thought that as I have some Dickies workwear trousers in this size, I'd get the same size shorts. They were 2-3 inches smaller round the waist than the Dickies workwear trousers I have.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 13 February 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Only difference is you can tell that these have never been unfolded. They have so much Scotchgard that they can literally stand in the corner lol. The reviews are correct which suggest getting a size a bigger because these for some reason seem to run small. I got a size bigger than what I normally wear and they fit perfectly.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 August 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"36","Shorts","Dickies Men's 13 Inch Loose Fit Multi-Pocket Work Short","Chris M.","Die w46 fällt aus wie w44 bzw. Binahe w42.Ursprünglich in w44 bestellt, welche viel zu klein war, obwohl ich bereits dutzende Hosen in dieser Größe habe die passen oder auch rutschen.In w46 nachbestellt, in der Annahme dass die Hose am Ende Wohl zu groß ist. Falsch gedacht. Die Hose ist so groß wie eine eng geschnitte Dickies in w44. Ich habe die Hosen übereinander gelegt und sie sind gleich groß.Dickies hat in den letzten Jahren die Größentabelle angepasst. Je nachdem wann die Hose produziert, konnte man 2 Hosen bestellen die trotz gleicher Größe unterschiedlich gepasst haben. Gleiches gilt auch für Hemden. Das Macht es schwer online zu bestellen.Wie immer eine super Qualität. Aber wenn man früher schon eine Nummer größer bestellen müsste aufgrund des kleinen Schnitts, sind es jetzt eher 2 Nummern.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
