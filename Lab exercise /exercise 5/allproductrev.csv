"8","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Philip","I usually order a pack of these every 6 months or so to use as undershirts, workout shirts, or just lounge-around-at-home shirts. They're quite comfortable, good quality and fit me very well. That is until this latest pack - it seems that the fabric quality or thickness has been reduced as this last pack is too lightweight. So lightweight that the shirts are verging on 'sheer' and you can see through them while dry, let along when you add a hint of sweat. Im not confident that this latest batch will even last for the next 6 months which is a shame. I'll see how it goes and report back.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 22 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"35","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Agis F.","I love Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton white T-shirts. I have probably bought more than a hundred of them for the last 15 years, mainly as work undershirts. Also, at home, there‚Äôs nothing like wearing a 100% cotton, soft and comfy shirt for all seasons. I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts  from Amazon. It‚Äôs also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen. I ordered my usual medium size, only to realize I indeed should have listened to the previous reviewers. I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me ‚Äì the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can‚Äôt complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging ‚Äì I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 11 March 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"36","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Un cliente","The Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Crew T-Shirt is a comfortable and reliable choice for everyday wear. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 23 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"40","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Chris Morrison","This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 2 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"46","T-shirt","Fruit of the Loom","Cliente de Amazon","Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 30 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

In fact I bought another brand at the same time also in XXL and laying one on top of the other showed a significant difference in size. The Hanes Beefy shirts are at least 3XL using other makes as a guide. It's not a huge issue, I wear tees in winter for layering, but they're so big they look daggy at the neck, the only part that shows. Made in Haiti so it's gratifying to see manufacturing in poor countries adjacent to the US. They are thick as advertised, but in the absence of significant shrinkage I'd go a size down, hoping of course that the size difference is consistent across the Hanes Beefy range (i.e. one size too big).

I suggested he try a Hanes Beefy-T, so he got a white one and loves it so much, I've purchased several in different colors for his Christmas gift.  As well made and long-wearing as these are, he should be set for quite some time.  Beefy-Ts are, without a doubt, the absolute best T-Shirts you can buy, and you definitely won't regret the purchase.  These are all cotton, so if you're vacillating about which size to buy, go with the larger one just to be sure it'll stiff fit beautifully after going through the washer and dryer.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 19 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It's extremely well made with just the right weight fabric to resist stretching AND tagless.  The fabric wears like iron to the point where the neckline of my favorite Beffy-T sleep shirt wore through after 8 years use before requiring replacement.

"355","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","Rick Shaw","These shirts are a great alternative to men's T-shirts. They are stylish and come in many colors (I own about 12 different colors). The ONLY thing to know about them is that they wear out quickly (like 2 seasons). I wear mine a lot (7 months out of the year they are my main t-shirt), so they get washed a lot and quickly take on the faded (burn-out) look. It's a nice look up to a point, and then the shirts just look threadbare. But at $20-35 per shirt (depending on when I buy them) they are still a great deal if they last only 2 years. The fabrics vary from color to color, even though you'd think they are all made of the same stuff. For instance, the ""white"" color clearly has more cotton in the blend and will last longer. Some colors, seemingly randomly, last longer than others. But again, they ALL look great when new and I get compliments on them all the time. Several of my male friends have pretty much abandoned their old t-shirts in favor of a collection of the Venice Burn-out shirts. I sure I'll be buying more of them!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 16 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"364","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","S. Harper","The cut of these shirts makes it look like I bought them on purpose, for the fit. Which I did. I bought one, loved the way it fit, and went back to buy 4 more in different colors. Great purchase.I'm 6'1, 215 with what clothing companies would call an ""Athletic build,"" Meaning I'm a big guy with broad shoulders, but not significantly overweight (maybe 10 pounds over, which for my body type isn't very much.) Most T-shirts for around $20 don't fit me very well. XL is usually too big, hanging like curtains below my shoulders. And L is generally right on the edge for me. If I'm 10 pounds over my normal, as I am right now (and likely will be for the foreseeable future), a size Large will be too tight across my chest.The wrong fit can really make me look bad by adding perceived weight, while the right fit usually brings a lot of ""Hey, did you lose weight?"" questions.These shirts, in an XL are perfect for me. Big enough to fit my shoulders, tapering a little bit in across my 'not bad' torso.  Well worth the extra money. Love them.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 October 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"368","T-shirt","Lucky Brand","Samuel Mathews","I‚Äôll start with the cons. After a few washes, the shirts pile up. (Tiny little cotton balls that pile up everywhere on the shirt) the colors do indeed fade, but who cares, it still looks good. I hardly ever gotten compliments on shirts but I did with these shirts but I didn‚Äôt get the shirts for that reason. They are very comfortable and have a great fit. Especially if you‚Äôre in the slightly athletic and up, build. Nice fit on the biceps. But not too tight, nice fit around the chest. It even accentuates your back quite well too. Look, they shirts are 20 bucks. Buy a couple colors you like, if you like them a lot, but one or two more of that same color and put them away for when they stop selling these shirts. They are worth the cons that everyone talks about.To make them last longer and keep their size. Never dry them using any heat, not even the delicate setting. I hang dry all of mine. I think air fluff dryer setting would work fine. Machine wash gentle. Even as they fade or ‚Äúpile‚Äù up, they are still a much better looking shirt than any logo or solid color tee. Buy one! You‚Äôll love it.True to size. Good length. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù 210, about a 40cm bicep.

These are all cotton, which I prefer, and are very soft and comfortable.  When washed and dried, they end up a wrinkly mess, so don't expect them to look like the ones pictured, except when you first take them from the package.  Speaking of which, why do they have to use the world's stickiest tape to stick to each rolled up shirt in the package?  You should take care in peeling this sticky tape from the shirt so you don't raise the nap and create a ""stripe"" where the tape was attached.

I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of Merino Protect's shirts. I now have 3 of them.  I'm a big fan of 100% merino wool - I commute by bicycle in NYC, and I prefer to wear 100% merino in all seasons.  Many other manufacturers have taken to blending their merino with man-made fibers, which detracts from the quality and experince.  This short sleeve model does a great job - the material is really soft and wicks sweat wonderfully. The length is perfect; it's a bit longer than a typical cotton T-shirt, which makes it just right for cycling.  I'm 5'8"", 170lb, and the medium fits me beautifully - stays close to my skin for wicking, without being too snug.I wanted to wait until I washed them a few times before writing this review, and I can tell you my Merino Protect shirts are holding up great and are as soft as new.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 December 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I have several merino wool long sleeve base layer shirts that I love for outdoors activities in winter (costing $80-120) but wanted short sleeve merino wool shirts for warmer weather and specifically for travel as they are light, soft & comfortable and don't hold body odor.  But check the prices of several top name brands.  So for $34 I took a chance and this is a solid shirt.  Merino wool T-shirts are not meant to be 'heavy'.  And 100% merino is not that strong and often is blended w polyester for strength.  So some care is required.  I purchased an XL, which is a bit tight.  There is some mild shrinkage if you don't wash in cold water and if you put it in a dryer, low heat for just a few minutes then lay flat to finish.  I liked the shirt so much I purchased 2 more in XXL and they are perfect at this price point.  Packaging was on point and no tears, holes or design flaws in the shirts.

My experience with Merino wool has always been positive in terms of its benefits and comfort. Recently, I decided to expand my travel wardrobe and purchased the Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirt, as well as a slightly less expensive option from MERINNOVATION.Though I haven't had the opportunity to put these shirts to the test during my travels yet, I couldn't resist trying them out during scorching 100-degree weather. The results were impressive! Among the Merino Wool Protect, MERINNOVATION, and regular cotton t-shirts, the Merino Wool Protect shirt stood out. Its design seemed to prioritize ventilation, allowing me to feel surprisingly cool despite the intense heat. In contrast, the MERINNOVATION shirt felt notably hotter than even the regular cotton tee, which was quite unexpected.I can't help but wonder if the variance in merino wool blends between these two shirts contributed to the significant difference in comfort levels. Regardless, the Merino Wool Protect shirt unquestionably emerged as the winner in this comparison. The superior cooling effect it provided was a game-changer, making it an obvious choice for my upcoming travels.Unfortunately, the MERINNOVATION shirt didn't live up to expectations and was promptly returned. It's clear to me that the Merino Wool Protect shirt is the real deal, offering both the benefits of merino wool and a thoughtfully engineered design for ventilation.While I'm eagerly awaiting the chance to put these shirts through their paces during actual travel scenarios, my initial experience with the Merino Wool Protect shirt leaves me optimistic and impressed. Its cooling performance and comfortable fit have already won me over. I can't wait to see how it performs on my next adventure!Pros:Impressive cooling performance even in extreme heatComfortable fit and designClear distinction from less effective alternatives like MERINNOVATIONCons:Limited testing opportunity so farOverall, highly recommended for anyone seeking quality merino wool clothing that truly delivers on comfort and cooling capabilities!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"601","T-shirt","Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirts for Men Odor Resistance Base Layer Lightweight Hiking Travel T-Shirt Soft Undershirt","JC","Good merino wool t-shirts like this are worth every penny. Beware of cheap ones that say ""merino wool"" and are actually spandex with a percentage of Merino that needs more than one digit of accuracy to show up.This was a well-made t-shirt at a very competitive price-point, that feels like wool. It's slightly scratchy to the touch compared to cotton, yet not ""rough"". You could not be faulted for thinking it's going to be itchy when you first feel it with your hands. But once it's on your body, it feels great: it regulates temperature beautifully without ever feeling suffocating, and coddles you unobtrusively. It stretches a surprising amount. And surprisingly for the weight, it does not collect body odor, and dries quite quickly when you wash it.As I mentioned in the title, I guffawed at the price, but once I tried it, I went back and bought some more, and since I bought them, I have worn no other t-shirts. I have thrown on a cotton t-shirt now & again, but every time, the entire time I'm wearing cotton I'm wondering ""why am I not wearing the nice t-shirts?""Update: a few months later, after these were not available for a while, I was so happy to see them back that decided to go all-in and buy 4 more. Sadly, their sizing and the thickness of the material have changed and not for the better.I will give them credit for feeling OK otherwise, but the L that fit perfectly before now feels thinner and sort of sloppy, esp. around the neck. Basically, they must be subcontracting the actual manufacturer, and the new maker went looser on the pattern. Not at all happy to have spent over $200 on 4 t-shirts that are lower quality, and not what I bought before, and they really *should* have announced in bold that the fit is completely different now, but still for someone in the 210/5'10 to 250-6'3 range the L should be a good fit now.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 September 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Well, I was wrong! I like them, and they seemed to be of just as good quality and fairly similar thickness of other high quality merino wool t-shirts. I am big on merino wool person, and having trekked over 12,000 miles in the last six years, always wear merino wool as a base layer and top layer. I also use merino wool clothing for everyday wear. I have many of the top brands, Meriwool, Merino.tech, Minus33, Woolly, Smartwool, Burton, and my favorite, Icebreaker. I have found over the years that most of clothing from the brand names companies are of fairly similar overall good quality, and now Merino Protect will be up there with merino wool clothing I‚Äôll buy.The material definitely is wool, and if you‚Äôve worn merino before, you‚Äôd notice that right away and not mistake it for any other material. The collar is not overly loose like many cheap t-shirts, and the stitching appears well made. I am 6‚Äô1‚Äù and was concerned with some of the reviews that noted it was short. I ordered x-large and it fits me well as I am about 195 lbs. If you are bigger, you might be out of luck. For me, before it was washed, it hung well below my belt, and almost to my crotch, plenty long for me. However, the sleeves seemed fairly short, but that is the style with most t-shirts, and I just like them long like the old traditional t-shirts.I have read several reviewers state that they thought this material was thin, and even cheap. To me it seems that these might be around 160-170 gm of merino wool, fairly standard for light to mid weight wool t-shirts. They are definitely not thin! Compared to cotton for sure, but if you‚Äôve never worn merino wool as an all around t-shirt, you might not know that this thickness and feel is typical of all merino wool t-shirts.I bought three black and one camo, and I am surprised and very pleased with the quality, and plan to buy several more for this price! I bought a lot of Merino.tech t-shirts when they first came out because they were price below everyone else because they were new. Now they are up there in price with all the other merino wool t-shirts, and maybe that‚Äôs why these are so very reasonably priced for a very good quality merino wool t-shirt. I‚Äôd say, get these at this price while you can.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 20 May 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars"

I wore them alternating days.  In Mexico November is pretty cold in the day and hot in the middle of the day.  It kept me warm in the morning when it was cold and in the afternoon walking all over the city the weather was warm and even hot.  I did sweat during the day and came back to the hotel without a smell.  I hang the shirt up in the closet and use the other one the next day.  Went hiking to the Pyramid in Mexico with a hot weather.  Sweat like crazy and came back to the hotel at night and shirt did not smell.  I did wash the shirt once due to some food spill.  My vacation was 15 days.  When I finally got back home, I wash them properly with mild soap and let it hand dried.  Seal it in a plastic bag to avoid moth from eating your shirt.

"605","T-shirt","Merino Protect 100% Merino Wool T Shirts for Men Odor Resistance Base Layer Lightweight Hiking Travel T-Shirt Soft Undershirt","jcsxyz2005","Having never experienced desert conditions, prior to a recent trip attending a wedding in Saudi Arabia I researched t-shirts that scored highest with respect to keeping cool. This compelled me to perform an experiment by purchasing two different highest-scoring wool t-shirt brands (because wool as a cooling solution simply seemed counterintuitive to me).  Here‚Äôs my review for this Merino Protect base layer t-shirt.First, and foremost, I‚Äôll start at the end and point out this shirt was not only the lower-priced of the two, the other shirt‚Äôs price skyrocketed from $47 at the time of the purchase to now (only a month later) $74 while (at the time of this review) this Merino Protect shirt is still available at $38 and is a best deal in my humble opinion. And that leads to point number 2:Yes, cotton and polyester t-shirts are easily available at half the price or less. However, I could never have worn a cotton or polyester t-shirt after walking around in Saudi Arabian afternoon sun without an odorous finish. Amazingly, this wasn‚Äôt this case for either of these two wool shirts purchased and tested on this wedding trip. In fact, that afternoon walk was the day after having worn this shirt as my base layer during the entire 20 travel hours of driving, flight, and layover time. Even my wife exclaimed surprise at how the shirt remained nearly odorless at the end of the second day in the Saudi sun.Benefit #3 is how well this shirt keeps its shape. After hand washing both and placing both on hangers to dry, the other higher-priced shirt ended up with a stretched shoulder on one side. This Merino Protect held up just fine. Lesson learned, BTW, as I now lay these flat to dry (hangers not recommended).My only complaint has much to do with why my wife calls me ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù when eating. Something liquidy landed on this shirt (gray color) and though I initially drenched the dime-sized spot with water and then a couple of hours later hand washed the shirt with extra emphasis on the stain spot, an echo of the spot remains. So what did I do as a result? I just placed two more of these shirts on my wish list promising my wife never to eat while wearing them without also wearing a bib.Wool is now my hot weather solution from now on. Who would have thunk it?","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 8 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

What I dislike about the product is the thinness. Ideally, it should be a little thicker, like a regular cotton t shirt. It is apparent that the company tried to use the least amount of fabric as possible to keep down the costs, but at the same time that is the only way to be affordable. All in all, I would say the thinness is still passable, and I can feel the good quality.

Not a big deal, but it's very lightweight-- it would last longer if the material were a little more substantial.The neck opening is so small! I like my shirts loose fitting, so I sized up to a men's large. I am a medium-sized woman (5'4"" and 130 lbs) and the neck is cut very high on me. I think it would be too tight on the size man this is meant for. And the inside of the neck is an overlocked seam-- it's not smooth. This would irritate my skin in that area, so I'm sadly sending it back (sad because I love the color.

I‚Äôll NEVER use polyester for something like that again. Wool is the way to go‚Äîlike I said, wore it every day, sweated it up, dried it overnight, maybe rinsed it a couple times, it did not stink up one bit.This T is half as expensive as that big-name-branded one. Why? This one has fewer panels, so it‚Äôs more of an ordinary fit, probably a good thing when you‚Äôve bulked up a bit since your last trip. It fits just like a size Large T meant for the outdoors should: trim, for me at 6‚Äô1‚Äù (now) 200 lbs, a size L in all US outdoor brands my whole adult life. Other than the additional panels for a slightly better/trimmer fit and the logo, I don‚Äôt see why the other T I used would cost double. The seams on this one all appear to be well done.I immediately threw this on and did a little biking to bouldering nearby. Worked up a sweat on a nice December day in NYC around 50 degrees. This T was PERFECT. Cotton would have been horrible, polyester smelly. I feel like wool somehow draws the stink away from the body and evaporates it, while polyesters only bake it in. You don‚Äôt do 21 straight days in the same polyester T shirt‚Ä¶Anyhow, this one has a perfect weight to it, about the same as a cotton T but thicker than your average polyester workout T.Bottom line: great product, I‚Äôll probably buy more.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 31 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It's got an elegant look too, a cut above cotton T's, and it's soft to the touch.I imagine on another vacation trip I could probably wear this one shirt for a week or more; and maybe pack a second one just in case I might like to rinse this one and let it dry for a day.

When you hand wash it, the water just bead off and you had to really soak it 100%. It was like it was sprayed with Scott Guard or something. So now, I just hand wash it again with dishwasher soap and drying on the coat hanger overnight hoping the itching will go away. I won't know until tomorrow when I test it again.I ordered size large and fit well. The neck is tighter than normal but not really tight. It really trap the heat in.The cloth is thin.

I bought this in a 4xl and it fits as I figured it would‚Ä¶slightly on the snug side (smaller than a 4xl but a tiny bit bigger than a 3xl which works for me.  I‚Äôd say it is closer to a 3xl fit wise than a 4xl or somewhere in between.  Great shirt tho!!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 13 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"662","T-shirt","UNDER ARMOUR Men's Tech 2.0 Short-Sleeve T-Shirt","BigTwinRider1964","I normally buy 3XLT or 4X/4xlt tees.. I am 6'0"", 290-300#, with a 30 inch inseam, so I'm short legged and very long torsoed. Given my girth and long body, I require a tall length otherwise my underbelly will show. NOBODY wants to see that.  This shirt fits me perfectly. I've got some pretty big  arms and the sleeves don't bind. The neck hole is just the right size, and I can reach up without exposing my gut. I am a bit older, I have grey chest hair, which a few random strands frequently poke through. That doesn't bother me. It's a work shirt. I'm not going to a celebrity gala function wearing this. I wish it did have a chest pocket. For pens, cards, earbuds, etc. But that's my only complaint. It's a good shirt.

I was skeptical with the sizing though. Being 100% cotton, I bought one size up. I like a medium fit, but I purchased size large. I put only one t-shirt in a regular wash and hot dry cycle. I have white/black. The black does bleed a little into the water, but stayed a true black after washing. The white section did not turn grey.  4 stars because they do shrink. The large turns into a medium size. As per my pictures, you can see the entire t-shirt shrunk 1 inch everywhere, body, sleeves.  I will be adding lettering so I needed to make sure sizing was washed out and that it would not shrink any further. I suppose the t-shirts may not shrink at all if they were washed in cold/warm water and hung to dry, skipping the hot dryer. I hope this helps anyone who is questioning sizing.

"1187","T-shirt","Champion Mens GT22H Graphic Jersey Muscle Sleeveless Shirt","Richie","I love sleeveless shirts because it's comfortable like a t-shirt, and loose fitting like a tank top.I'm a tall guy (6'5"") and I bought the large size. Here is my feedback after wearing and washing it twice:Pros:- Fast delivery- White shirt looks fantastic- Length is great for my long torso- I washed in warm and hung dry with no change in shape or color.- Makes my arms look good! HahaCons:- Fabric could be a bit softer- It's a touch too baggy for me, but then again, I have gotten used to it and it still looks really good on me being tall and slim.- It's a bit expensive.Final Thoughts:I am happy with this purchase and ended up buying the dark blue one too. I really like these shirts and I feel they are worth the money even though you are paying for the brand name. I do recommend this shirt, especially if you have a longer torso like me.Hope this helps!! Thanks.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 14 July 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"1228","T-shirt","Champion Mens GT22H Graphic Jersey Muscle Sleeveless Shirt","Aldo","This is actually a good product, the material isn‚Äôt that thick cotton feel that champion uses as a signature material on most of there regular sleeved shirts. This is a regular standers thin cotton. Important to know that the shoulders extend outward. Further than most sleeveless tanks. I think this is just a style for this design. Some tanks don‚Äôt have an extended shoulder. This one does. The size is a bit bigger. Don‚Äôt expect a perfect fit. I wouldn‚Äôt say order a size down but expect it to feel loose and a bit baggy. This is not fitted, so all you body builders who want that snugged feel or to accent your small waist and emphasize your shoulders this isn‚Äôt the fit. It‚Äôs a bit more boxy. The solid logo on the back of the shirt gives it a very expansive casual feel. So this is gym appropriate but also going for a walk down the pier and grabbing an outdoor lunch appropriate too. This look will def compliment a chain and bracelet  accessories without you looking too try hard. Over all def worth the price point! Finally another amazon hit. Go for it!

"1298","Shorts","Real Essentials 5 Pack: Men's Dry-Fit Sweat Resistant Active Athletic Performance Shorts","AS","I have two sets of these shorts, one I purchased in august of 2020 and one in august 2021. Clearly I went back to buy another set a year later so I must like them, and I do. They are priced INCREDIBLY well. At the time of the first purchase, I had just started playing sports again and needed lightweight shorts to cut and move in. These are DEFINITELY those shorts. They breath very well, they're comfortable enough that now I not only work out in them, I lounge around the house in them and go to sleep in them as well. They've held up pretty well to washing. I wash them on hot with powdered detergent and oxiclean powder and rinse them twice and then dry them on medium heat. They've probably gone through at least 100 washes thus far and I'm still wearing them. Yes, some of the seams have loose thread, yes some of them start to come off over time but they're $6 a short and none of them have unraveled to the point that there are any holes or they are unwearable, it's just something you would see when you look at the inner part of the waistband.The ONE weakness of these shorts is the pockets. I've had several that have started developing holes in the side seams of the pockets. Now it only started happening a year+ later and they've been beat up and washed many times so that's not quite so bad, but still it'll happen. I suspect this is more to do with how big and heavy phones are nowadays since it's always on my right pocket (where my phone goes) and started pretty much after I upgraded from an iphone 7 to an iphone 13 pro. But two years and 100+ aggressive washings later, only 3 out of 10 shorts have pocket holes and only one has a hole big enough that I'm scared to put my phone in the pocket.These are fantastic shorts and they could easily charge double. I plan to replace some of the original ones with a new set even now.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 September 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Was immensely disappointed in those 2 cheaper shorts (they were stained and seemed to be in a warehouse for some time as the elastic in the waistband was audible when stretched as if already dry-rotting).The correct shorts were great, they were much thinner than I expected, but very breathable and elastic. Decided to give it another shot and purchased the same item once more and actually got 5 correct branded shorts this time, same quality that I was hoping for. This time there was even a thank you card in the packaging and the packaging was different to my first order.

The 5 pack was a 3x for me. They weren't even close what I had expected. The string to tie the shorts was short and such. That I had 1 side or the other ending up pulled into the enclosed part of the shorts where the string comes through. So it's frustrating because once this happens. We'll it's very challenging to retrieve the string.Also from the size descriptions. My size should have been perfect according to Amazon's statistics and what my purchase history has been. Got the big and tall shorts in 3x and they were loose. Had to really since uo the rope or string. It was fine.The five pack is very fairly priced. Felt that it would be awesome. Had ordered the quick dry shirts in big and tall. Now those were from the same company. Ordered 3 sets of 3 shirts packs.Will continue buying from this company. Price is very reasonable. Love that you get a wide variety of colors and packs of 3 to 5 items. The clothing is well packaged and arrives in a fair timely fashion. As a bigger heavier man. Like that they carry the variety of sizes that fit bigger people. Because it's hard finding products in the 3x and bigger sizes.Personally live black and dark blue.  So if those colors are available. Will purchase them. Recommend this company's products for everyone.Well, try them,  and enjoy. Will see you in the next review. Thanks again for your patience and time. Do not like putting any negative thought about anything. It's a trial and error world.That's the amazing thing about Amazon. If you got a problem.

They fit on the normal side, maybe a tad large.The double left-hand cellphone pocket in the font is such a good design choice.The black are formal enough to wear to a more classy event.The anti-stain material is no joke, water and other things just repel off of them.The pockets are mesh inside.Cons:The 2 cargo pocket zippers are a bit difficult to zip.No zipper on back pocketsIts sometimes hard to remember that these shorts use snap buttons","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 21 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

These feel kinda cheap; the fabric feels like it could tear fairly easily while the store bought pair, despite being used heavily for cycling for months and washed many times are now faded but the fabric and stitching are fine.Edit to my previous post ...My previous opinion was that I wouldn't buy these again but now after using them for some time, the fabric is holding out very well .... still feel very light and the mesh pockets are a little shallow.  Still a decent short.  I do hope they come out with the original pair of Wrangler shorts I bought almost two years ago.  They have a much sturdier fabric though a little heavy in really hot summer days.

"1341","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Darlut & MyCorn","Size: I'm legit 38"" if not a little more. A lot of the reviews say true to size so I ordered the 38"".  If I lost a pound and jumped up and down they would have fallen to my ankles.  I guess if you like wearing a belt and like that really loose feel then stick to the 38"".  I'm big shoulders no butt so I need that little bit of extra tension to keep my drawers up. I reordered the 36"" and they fit great. Puts the ""Flex"" to a little but of test but that's what it's there for and it's comfortable. Also the smaller size looks better because the legs aren't so large. There was a huger difference between the 38"" and 36"".Performance: I usually graduate my clothes to ""yard gear"" after they have had a year or so of normal wear. I immediately put these to the test doing yard work and I will wear these from now on.  They were light which kept me cool, the waist was flexible but comfortably snug and the front pockets were deep enough to hold my phone with no issues. I push-mow a large yard and bag the clippings. My neighbors will appreciate that now when I bend over to remove the bagger they won't be confused that a plumber is doing my yardwork. Highly recommend these and also recommend the Flex version of the Wrangler jeans that are sized in a similar fashion.  I have bought another pair and will likely buy a few more. I would even work out at the gym in these when that time comes... maybe having these will motivate me to get there.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 7 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"1347","Shorts","Wrangler Mens Performance Comfort Flex Waist Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","BryWill32606","I am able to wear shorts to work and I saw these and figured to give them a try.  First I must say, as a guy I am used to the demin or thick cotton feel for pants/shorts, these are not that feel. These are a stretchy material. When wearing them they are very comfortable and when you sit, as a guy the material is stretchy so you can sit down comfortably without issues. They look like regular shorts, I feel the waistband is a little wider but not in a bad way. I have washed this pair 3x now, they wash well, no fading or coming apart as I read in one review but they do look wrinkly, not bad enough to have to iron them, besides when you put them on the wrinkles seem to go away, I think its the stretchy material that makes them look that way. I paid $27 for this paid off shorts and it's about as hight as I would want to pay. I do need to mention that I did order a second pair, black as these are more of an olive color.

For the sake of comfort I bought them one size larger than what I usually buy, and they fit perfectly. The zippered pockets are just big enough for a Samsung Galaxy A53 phone, with some minor difficulty in closing and opening the zipper once the phone is in the pocket. The only disappointment is that the front button is not a button at all, but a snap-on  as shown in the picture. My experience with snaps is that they have broken off after some use, so I will be careful using this one. I was pleasantly surprised by the extra pocket inside the left front pocket. All of the front pockets are deep enough to securely hold your keys and wallet. Edited to say: I bought these at a different size five months later. The material in the first pair I bought looks quite worn, from use and washings, compared to the newer pair.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The wear and tear has me looking at re-uping the whole wardrobe. I ordered my first pair of shorts and was happy opening. 1st noticed they changed from a button to a snap fastener, meh, okay, prefer button. 2nd notice was a bigger deal, these shorts are two inches longer inseam length than the previous line. At 5'9"" I liked that the old shorts were just above the knee. Any shorts that hang below the knee are a grotesque late 90's jnko white trash look. 3rd, with the extra length, these new line shorts sit higher on the waist. It feels like the belt needs to sit an inch below the navel rather on the hips like the old line.PROS: Love the elastic fabric, light weight, great form fit for muscular legs, most comfortable shorts I've ever owned.CONS: Downgrade from previous years, longer, sits higher, snap fastener, binding after washing, stitching has never been top quality.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The absolutely most important feature of these shorts that is not evident on the Amazon web site is that they truly have STRETCH. I an a waist 33 and I ordered a 32. They fit perfectly since the waist and the pants have great stretch. They would also fit perfectly for someone with a 32 inch waist. Too many pants on the internet are described as having a stretch feature, but in fact do not. Secondly, there is not description of the pockets. These shorts have 7 pockets, but you would not know it from the website. Zippers are on the two side cargo pockets so you can secure your phone and wallet in these pockets if you will be exercising. The other pockets are deep, as is the ""watch"" pocket. Great fabric. I reordered another pair after wearing the first pair.

"1443","Shorts","ZENGVEE 3 Pack Men's Compression Shorts Cool Dry Running Base Layer Shorts with Phone Pockets for Running,Training, Workout, Gym","Robert Sette","These are great semi-compression shorts.  Why do I say ""semi-compression"" you ask?  Well, real compression shorts are expensive, around $30 and up per pair.  Too pricey to have enough to wear daily.I have dysautonomia from Covid, and it really has turned my life upside down.  Blood pressure and flow to limbs is affected.  My doctor suggested I wear compression socks and underwear to help with blood flow issues.I purchased 3 different brands to see which were the best.  I bought these (Zengvee), Telaleo, and Niksa, all from Amazon.  The Zengvee are definitely my favorite. While all three are the same length (see picture), the other 2 brands were more high-waisted than the Zengvee, making the Zengvee effectively longer on my legs.  The other 2 brands tend to have a waistband that rolls.  The Zengvee waistband didn't roll, and seem to be a bit thicker than the other 2 brands.  After several months of wearing them, the Zengvee are the definite winner.  They are comfortably snug as expected without being uncomfortable.One side note; when I bought them, all 3 brands claimed to be 85% polyester and 15% spandex.  Since I need compression to regulate my blood pressure, I assumed more spandex would equal more compression.  Unfortunately, of the 3 brands I bought, only the Telaleo were actually 15% spandex, even though all 3 brands are advertised as 15% spandex.  I don't notice a difference in the actual compression while wearing them, but was annoyed at the deceptive marketing claims.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 29 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"1577","Shorts","Champion Men's Long Mesh","SK","Five-star review, but let me get some of the downsides out of the way for those who might consider these downsides:1) They are mesh gym shorts. Because of that, they do have a little bit of a see-through effect. So don't be surprised if you buy the white ones and you go out wearing them and people can tell what color underwear you're wearing. (Protip: Wear underwear.)2) I've bought these in multiple colors. They are all true-to-size, excepting that the default ""athletic gray"" one seems to fit a little more snugly. (It also doesn't have the little split on the side of the leg, which makes me wonder if I was delivered the wrong thing on that particular purchase; who knows?) So caveat emptor on the athletic-gray color. But the rest fit great.3) A couple of the colors on these may not look exactly like they do on your computer or phone screen, but for my taste they are even better. The Swiss Blue looks like a nice cheery blue without looking faded. The Team Gold looks like a rich golden color without being either faded or bright as a disco ball.That said:These are great. They are comfy. They are great for working out. They are great for lazing around eating potato chips on the couch. And they are great for doing Zoom calls so you can go casual out of sight while you're wearing a shirt and tie up top.I'm the kind of guy who, when I'm at home, likes to wear clothes that I don't have to think about and say to myself, ""Oh, yeah, I'm wearing clothes."" These pretty much hit the mark on that. These are now long-term fixtures of my stay-at-home wardrobe.FYI: The inseam on these goes just past my knees.For care: Just make sure you don't put these in the dryer too long or too hot. Consider putting them in the dryer on low, and then if they're still a little damp, hanging them to air dry the rest of the way.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Singapore on 17 June 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I've gone through/returned so many and different brands as well because they were too small/too big/too loose/too tight/uncomfortable/etc. you name it. You need high quality compression shorts so you're not constantly adjusting yourself in the gym/on a run/etc. These shorts are super high quality, perfect amount of stretch on the waist line as well as the area protecting the goods, perfect amount of compression without being uncomfortable.

"1636","Shorts","Wrangler","Rayman","This cargo shorts is the best one I bought so far compared to all other brands. It is lightweight and soft compared to other brands that feels heavy when worn. It is true to its size and love that sizes have odd number options 29, 31, 33 unlike other brands which only has even number sizes e.g. 32, 34, 36 etc. It fits exactly as I want it to be. The additional pockets are so great to have that you can use and forget carrying a small bag in some occasions. The delivery was swift and courier was courteous enough to let me know it's delivered. Overall I am satisfied and thank you seller for the best service!

I did send one pair back to be replaced becasue the zipper stuck, I certainly don't think that's becasue of lack of quality, it some times happens, but these shorts are built very well but aren't too thick and heavy.

"1653","Shorts","Wrangler","RiiDeemed","I've always had Wrangler products in the past (mostly jeans) but I've come across a few of their cargo shorts.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this pair of pants as I've had bad experiences in the past with older companies going ""cheap"" and sacrificing quality for the sake of better margins (i.e. Levi's).This pair of pants definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, comfort and style!  It fit very snug and the premium twill is worth the extra $ and the pricing is still competitive enough to consider this a bargain.  I was expecting a bit more ""padding"" in terms of the material used as it is a bit thinner compared to previous pants I've worn from Wrangler.  It doesn't seem like it will wear out quickly so maybe the thinner material was done on purpose to help with comfort in the heat.  I've owned these for about 3 years now and they are still going strong!  Finally made the time to review these.  Will consider buying more of these in the future!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 9 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Even if I could try to get it into the pocket with a lot of effort it would be a time consuming process to remove it.  Older phones (real old ones) might fit.

"1727","Shorts","Lee Men's Dungarees New Belted Wyoming Cargo Short","SteveInFrisco","These shorts feel super soft and great against the skin. I like the look of them too. My complaints are that these are cut a little big so I had to return the first order and then order a size smaller. They also don't stay up on your waist since the fabric is so soft and the belt that comes with them doesn't really stay tight but slowly start to slip lose when you move around, especially if you have something heavier in your pockets like my Note 10+ phone which has some heft. I find myself pulling up the pants back to my waist and pulling the belt snug several times a day when running errands or working outside. It would be awesome if they added a non-slip waist band to these like my golf shorts have on the inside of the waist band. Also if the included belt had more grip texture so it would keep from slipping loose when you move around.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 10 November 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"1740","Shorts","Canterbury Advantage Short","Rugby","Edit 29th Apr 18. Worn about 20 times since purchase and now ripped at stitching at rear seam whilst squatting. This is not at the stretch panel, shame they didnt use a bit of the stretch panel at the rear seam.Over all still good shorts but just cant handle heavy squatting. I am tempted to try a larger size see if the extra room will perform better.Very strong shorts with stretch material in backside area which is good for squatting, as they don‚Äôt rip like most do under heavy load. They have a good rise as well which is rare in today‚Äôs climate of shorts hanging half way down your backside. However they are totally let down when it comes to leg room. I purchased a size up from what I needed as recommended in another review and they are barley loose on my thighs. After squatting in them I have been left with red marks and bruising where the material has been so tight around my thighs. I thought rugby shorts would be good due to the leg size of the players, clearly not in this case. If you have larger thighs (mine are only 29 inches, so I don‚Äôt consider them large at all) and plan on doing gym work I would avoid these. Such a shame as could have been perfect with 1-2 more inch of thigh room.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 1 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I wear these primarily for no-gi Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and am very pleased with their performance overall. BJJ-oriented brands commonly offer lower quality shorts at nearly double the price.There are just a couple of things I would love to see improved:- The black shorts appear to be very dark blue. If you wear them with anything else that's actually black, the contrast can be pretty obvious.- The ""legs"" could be slightly stretchier to enable greater mobility. There is an elastic panel in the crotch area, and the leg openings are generously sized, but additional elastic panels on the fronts/sides of the legs would be nice.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Having quite big thighs and butt, I struggle with most training pants, particularly at the bottom of the squat. I have ripped several trousers this way and the result with some shorts is that they stick on the thighs and pull the waistband down, so I end up partially mooning the rest of the gym while in the squat rack!The added thick lycra/ stretch areas around the groin and sides of the thighs mean these babies stay right where you put the on and no risk of exploding out of them. Tough and durable as well and the material doesn't fade when washed.

The length is perfect, not too long and not too short, just above the knees.  The crotch area is very comfortable, when you sit your friends will not get crushed.  Pockets are nice and deep, I can fit my iPhone 13 Max comfortably and without having to constantly adjust and it doesn't leave a big imprint, even when i sit down the phone is not in the way.  I am 5'9"" and 180 Lbs athletic build and waist 35 fits me very well.  The cloth and workmanship is also good.  My plan is to eventually buy all the colors.  So the fit, the style, the cloth, the tailoring all combine to give you a relaxed summery shorts.  if you are looking for skinny fit tight shorts then don't get these.

In bright light like in the photo of me wearing them, they do appear lighter but it's not obnoxious.I would refer to these more as burgundy than orange but color perception can be variable across people.I am not the kind of person who wears bright colored shorts that stand out. My other shorts are tan, light grey, dark gray, khaki... These burnt sienna shorts are on the edge of my comfort zone but I really like them!As for the shorts themselves, I love them. I already have several other pairs of Volcom shorts. They are casual but look polished. The length falls at my knee (I'm 6 feet tall). They have a slightly slim cut so they aren't baggy.

"1962","Shorts","Lee Mens 21861 Extreme Motion Swope Cargo Short Cargo Shorts","Jessica Jeppesen","The comfort level of these shorts is outstanding. The fabric has just the right amount of stretch, allowing for unrestricted movement during any physical activity. Whether I'm hiking, cycling, or simply lounging around, the shorts never feel restrictive or uncomfortable. The waistband is adjustable and features a flex waist for a customizable fit, adding to the overall comfort factor.In terms of durability, the Lee Men's Extreme Motion Swope Cargo Shorts certainly impressed me. I have worn them on multiple occasions, and they have held up remarkably well. The construction feels solid, and the stitching is strong, ensuring that these shorts will withstand the test of time. Even after frequent use and washing, I have not noticed any signs of wear or tear.The cargo pockets are another notable feature of these shorts. They provide ample storage space for essentials like keys, a phone, or a small wallet. The pockets are deep enough to securely hold items, and the Velcro closures ensure that nothing falls out during physical activities or when you're on the move.The only reason I deducted one star from the rating is that, while the shorts are durable overall, the color tends to fade slightly after repeated washes. However, this is a minor drawback and doesn't significantly impact the functionality or overall appeal of the shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 February 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2003","Shorts","UNIONBAY Men's Survivor Belted Cargo Short-Reg and Big & Tall Sizes","Atnorton","I first ordered size 36, the size I wear in my Carhartt shorts, but the size was much too larger. I returned them and ordered the shorts in a size 34, but these were too big. I returned them for a refund. I liked the features of the UnionBay brand, so I ordered them in a size 32, they fit perfect! Although, I was surprised that they seamed to be made of o heavier cloth material and the small pocket, on each leg, did not have a flap over the pocket. I used the small pocket for small items, like nail clippers, small Leatherman, etc.. The very first day I wore one of the pairs, I lost my favorite nail clippers. A real bummer. Lesson learned: Don't put anything anything in the small pockets because you have a very good chance of loosing whatever you put in them. Other than that, I love the quality of all the different pairs I ordered.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 24 September 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2006","Shorts","UNIONBAY Men's Survivor Belted Cargo Short-Reg and Big & Tall Sizes","Tiffaney","Pro's  They use Velcro instead of buttons on the pocket flaps, it makes it so much easier to open. Buttons make the flaps wrinkle when not buttoned up. Well stitched, The front pockets are deep, so things won't fall out, well worth the money to me. Con's would be that they are 11 inch inseam, and is over the top part of my knee cap. I prefer a 9 inch inseam. Last time I bought cargo shorts was 15 years ago, and the material is thinner then my old ones. The small front pocket on the left side, made for a key fob doesn't have a Velcro flap, and you could possibly lose your key fob if it were to fall out. The belt looks ok, but I use my own belt. I did like these so much, that I decided to buy more.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 28 June 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Side pocket depth is good, flaps adequate. I like the velcro closures on the pocket flaps. I dont use the rear pockets. No current problem with my stitching, after 1 wash. Fabbed in Shri Lanka. Fabric is decent thickness and soft. Minimal number of belt loops. I like the color (Android), it looks like the pic. 1 point off for the zipper, which the up/down movement is not smooth, concern the this may limit the life of the shorts. Also the belt is a waste of material. Should can the belt and put that savings into a better, smoother operating zipper, then I'd give these shorts a 5!

With that said, I'm pleasantly surprised! I've tried a number of cheaper brand shorts from Amazon over the years, and these are the perfect balance of fit, price, and weight without being see through. Are they the quality of a pair of $50 shorts from Nike? Well, no, but you're getting 5 pair for less than one of those, and I'd say the quality is 85-90% of the way there.The main problem I tend to have with cheap shorts is the fit. More often than not, they end up being too tight in the groin area, which makes them sit awkwardly on your thighs/butt. Not these though, they hang just right, and look just how they should.

"2084","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Zenguy","I prefer a basic, no-frills, inexpensive workout short for my exercise activities (about 1-1.5 hours per day, 3-4 times per week). After years of buying Champion brand, I decided to give the Russell product a try based on positive reviews. I found these to be a good value. What I like most about them is the fit, which is a bit looser and longer than the Champion model.  At 5'8"", 165 lbs with a 33 waist, medium is just perfect for me. The material is smooth and breathes well. The waist is snug enough for the shorts to stay put, but not too tight to be comfortable. I like the pockets, which I use to hold my little iPod shuffle during my workouts. Overall a solid product and sufficient for my purposes.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 2 March 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2101","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","sallyftw","I don't usually review items promptly but the customer service is something to talk about.  I ordered a size L and they sent me an M.  The paper tag said L but the actual tag on the shorts said M so the mix-up was understandable.  I ordered a size L a second time so they would arrive on time for my boyfriend's birthday and emailed amazon about returning the size M.  I heard back right away from the seller and was told that my money will be refunded and that I do not have to go through the hassle of returning the shorts.The new shorts that were correctly labeled size L on both tags came in today and they are great.  The Texas Orange is a beautiful burnt copper color and I couldn't be happier about it.  The shorts themselves are long which is great because my boyfriend is 6ft 4 and has trouble with basketball shorts being too short sometimes, but these will look great on him.  The pockets are a big plus because he likes to have a place to put his keys and phone when he goes out.  The elastic on the shorts is really strong but very stretchy meaning that they will be comfortable but won't fall down.  What I loved the most about the shorts is how thin the material is.  My boyfriend gets very sweaty and always complains about shorts being 'too hot' but these are so airy and light that I think he will love them.  I will be ordering in more colors after I get his take on these shorts.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2104","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","Haron Deinla","These shorts were definitely worth the buy. A lot better than I had expected, and here's why:-the shorts a very comfy. That may be due to the mesh being a little bit bigger in perforations as compared to other mesh shorts. The perforations are big enough to provide more than enough breathing room and ventilation, but not so big that the shorts are super-see through.-the material not only feels good but looks good. I ordered the green colorway and it looks really nice. I'm even planning on making another order, that is if I decide whether or not these are better quality than Champion branded shorts.-it has pockets which is a must for me when it comes to shorts I plan to use on a consistent basis to be able to hold my keys and wallet.-the drawstring is also strong enough so that if I were to have my phone, keys and wallet in my pockets, the shorts won't drop.All in all, these shorts are really nice, both for home use and outdoor use for walking and sports alike.If I were able to help you make a purchase, or help you prevent from making one you'd regret.

"2128","Shorts","Russell Athletic Men's Mesh Short with Pockets","D.D.","(I did not receive any compensation, discount or free products for my review. I don't work for this company. This is just flat honesty.)  The first thing I can say is I am pleasantly surprised that shorts of this quality come at such a low price point. That is a big selling point here. I could buy Nike, but why when I can get the same thing for $11-$12 bucks? That seems like a waste of money. Mind you, I'm not a, ""Keep up with the Jones' kind of guy.)  So, unless you just have to have a ""brand,"" buy 3 or 4 pair of these instead.  **After having having several pair of these shorts for over a month I came back to edit my review from a 4 star rating to a 5. I suppose since I've already ordered several additional pair I really like them. I wear them around the house every day. They are extremely comfortable - not only for relaxing but for yard work, painting, etc. In fact, I like these shorts so much that I hate it when I don't have a pair clean, so like I said, ""I ordered more!""  I live in central hell, where the summer climate is so hot that the last thing you want to do is work outside or in a hot garage. Yet, the mesh fabric accomplishes its job -matching the description. The mesh allows heat to escape and maintain a cool feeling without trapping in sweat. (Whomever created the fabric should be rich by now.) When beckoned I come in from the garage, sit down at the dinner table and the shorts are throughly dry.  *The shorts launder easily and hold up well in hot water and a hot dryer. No special steps required. I don't like athletic shorts that you can't just toss in the dryer. Some expensive shorts state, ""Wash only. Hang to dry."" That's too much work! Draw string is one piece with a knot below, so you don't have to worry about loosing the string in the washer and then trying to find it and put it back in. (I hate that.)  Exercising: I've worked out for 35 years, and I can tell you these are some of the coolest and most comfortable shorts I've ever worn. The pockets are the perfect depth. There is plenty of room to fit my keys and iphone 6-plus. Unlike some shorts, whatever is in my pocket's stays there. It does not fall out. (The manufacturer gets some points there.) I don't have to worry about loosing my keys, an adventure I'd rather skip. (Of course, be logical.) I wouldn't recommend engaging in heavy athletic activities with expensive items in your pocket, yet I can wear the shorts to make a quick trip to the store without my phone falling out.  Importantly, there is plenty of room in the circumference of the legs to allow for men with very muscular thighs. The fabric stretches a bit, but will not remain stretched out. If you have huge thighs you might consider ordering a size larger than normal unless you fancy very tight shorts? I've never had that issue. There is ample room in the crotch for any man; however, be aware that you will not get any athletic support from the shorts. So, depending you your preference and need you may wish to wear protection underneath.  Lastly, the shorts are a bit longer than I expected. The waist to knee measures 19"" and the crotch to bottom of shorts is 13"". I am 6'3"", and the bottom meets the top of my knee.  That is a thorough review of the shorts. I hope it helps you make an educated decision.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 12 May 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The pants, as they come, are really light way and comfortable. Length and fit felt great.Only thing I hated was that the back pockets were sewn semi-shut (meaning there are actual pockets, but they stitch it closed inside). This was almost a dealbreaker as I'm used to reserving those pockets for my wallet and phone, but I was able to cut the stitching so they are functional. 4/5 as the pants come. 5/5 after the alteration.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 19 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2253","Shorts","LEE Men's Carpenter Jean Short","Big-D","Whether its a pair of jeans or shorts, I prefer Lee brand. Why? Not only do they fit perfectly and are very comfortable, but they have those little pockets on the side of the right leg that perfectly holds a cell phone or a pair of glasses in the case. At 40 my eyes kind of went down hll, so I always have my reading glasses with me. I don't like carrying them in my ants pocket, because the wire frames get all bent up. If I have a shirt pocket, I'll end up losing my glasses because they always want to fall out. So the easy solution is to wear Lee Carpenter jeans and shorts. If you carry your phone or glasses around all of the time, try a pair of these on for size. You won't lose your phone or your glasses with these on and they fit and look great too! What more can you ask for?Edit: I really wanted to give these shorts a Five Star Rating, but when they arrived, one of the belt loops had been poorly sewn and because I use the belt loops to hang my car keys with garage door opener from, that is a big issue with me. If I had purchased these from a local store, I would have noticed the bad sewn belt loop and put them back to select a different pair. This defect is the fault of Amazon, not the quality of the shorts themselves. I still love the fit and usual finish of these shorts and their pants.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 December 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The unstretched dimensions are ok, but the elastic stretches far too easily and almost doubles in size! I'm not that kind of build, so while they seem great quality for the price, you need to be quite large for these shorts not to slip down...as for using the pockets...this could be quite embarrassing with a mobile phone and or wallet! The drawstring is interesting - it is a loop, and may need to be cut to be able to be tied in a bow.

That's just my opinion, of course, so if you're the type of dude to wear old, ratty, grey sweats, or worn-out t-shirts with the sleeves personally cut-off, out in public -by all means, knock yourself out!I've had several pairs of these over the last decade, and they're my go-to sleep-shorts. All of my original purchases were at Sports Authority, then 2 from Amazon within the last year.Although they are pretty lightweight and soft, the shorts are comparatively quite durable, as none of mine have ever worn through or come apart -- I just seem to lose a pair every couple of years, on a trip or at a hotel stay, then re-purchase.  The current shorts' material is approximately the same as my originals, but the stitching around the waistband is much less detailed, and frankly looks a bit sloppy.  The older shorts had very detailed, sturdy, and useful stitching around the waist and drawstring-area -I've attached some pics for comparison.  My recent purchase had long strands of excess thread dangling from some of the stitching.  I had to trim all of this off, in lieu of better quality control at the factory or by the distributor.The inner tag is still annoyingly sewn into the vertical seam right at the top of your tailbone (butt-crack, to be crass), so I just carefully cut it out before the first laundering.I'm not a fan of logos -- but for information's sake, the logo used to be embroidered onto the leg and now it's simply silkscreened-on.The fit is ""as-expected"".I'm not super-happy with the waistband change or the loose thread everywhere, but I got my recent pair for half-off during prime-day, so -Score!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Mexico on 16 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"2469","Shorts","G-Star Men's Sato Denim","BigBalu","Bewertung: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3/5)Die G-Star Raw Herren Short im Modell Casual ist eine solide Wahl f√ºr einen l√§ssigen Look. Hier sind meine Eindr√ºcke von dieser Shorts:1. Stil und Design: Das Modell Casual bietet einen entspannten und l√§ssigen Stil, der gut zu verschiedenen Freizeitaktivit√§ten passt. Die Shorts haben eine angemessene L√§nge und einen lockeren Schnitt, der Bewegungsfreiheit erm√∂glicht. Das Design ist schlicht und zeitgem√§√ü, ohne dabei besonders auff√§llig oder herausragend zu sein.2. Verarbeitung und Qualit√§t: Die Verarbeitungsqualit√§t der Shorts ist in Ordnung, aber nicht au√üergew√∂hnlich. Die N√§hte sind ordentlich, und die Materialien f√ºhlen sich robust an. Allerdings k√∂nnte die Qualit√§t etwas verbessert werden, da einige K√§ufer von Problemen mit der Haltbarkeit berichtet haben.3. Passform und Komfort: Die Shorts bieten eine bequeme Passform, die nicht zu eng oder zu weit ist. Der Stoff ist leicht und angenehm zu tragen, insbesondere in warmen Sommermonaten. Allerdings k√∂nnten sie f√ºr einige Personen m√∂glicherweise etwas zu lang sein, je nach pers√∂nlichen Pr√§ferenzen und K√∂rperbau.4. Vielseitigkeit: Die G-Star Raw Herren Short im Modell Casual l√§sst sich gut mit verschiedenen Oberteilen und Schuhen kombinieren, um unterschiedliche Looks zu kreieren. Sie eignet sich f√ºr Freizeitaktivit√§ten wie Spazierg√§nge, Outdoor-Aktivit√§ten oder den Strand. Allerdings ist sie vielleicht nicht f√ºr formellere Anl√§sse geeignet.5. Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis: Das Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis der Shorts ist angemessen. Sie liegt im mittleren Preissegment und bietet solide Qualit√§t und Stil, ohne jedoch besondere Merkmale oder Premium-Materialien zu bieten.Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass die G-Star Raw Herren Short im Modell Casual eine durchschnittliche Wahl f√ºr einen l√§ssigen Look ist. Sie bietet einen entspannten Stil, eine bequeme Passform und gute Vielseitigkeit. Allerdings k√∂nnte die Qualit√§t verbessert werden, und der Preis ist im Verh√§ltnis zur gebotenen Leistung angemessen, aber nicht au√üergew√∂hnlich.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Germany on 8 July 2023","4.5 out of 5 stars"
